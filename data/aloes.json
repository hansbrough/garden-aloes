    ],
    "overview": "This perennial, stemless and generally solitary succulent native to Zimbabwe is a large and showy outdoor plant in frost-free zones. Be sure give this attractive aloe with its yellow to reddish orange flowers a place in your garden. A distinctive South African species grown partly for its ornamental spiny foliage, partly because of its colorful flowers and partly due to its far greater than average cold tolerance.",
    "description": "Distinctive aloe in having numerous very sharp spines on ALL surfaces of the thick, heavy and fleshy leaves. This stemless aloe forms a single, dense rosette of up to 1 m high and wide. The upper parts are curved inwards, which gives the rosette a rounded appearance. Leaves somewhat incurved, up to 60 cm long, grey-green when fresh, purple-bronze under dry conditions, with scattered prickles on whitish tubercles, mainly on the undersurface of the leaves. Leaves are long and quite broad at the base , 120mm wide, from dull green to turquoise with reddish-brown triangular teeth (or thorns) on the margins and undersides. The leaf margins are armed with reddish brown, triangular teeth. Each thorn originates from a thick base, which in some forms is a lighter color than the rest of the leaf, giving it a dotted appearance. These warty spines have a white base, which is very unusual in the aloe world. The spininess is variable, and many older plant populations have no more spines. Curls up in an interesting fold when exposed to high heat and sun. Robust, generally solitary or in small groups, but non-suckering. In optimal light conditions, it turns a lovely red or orange.",
    "flowering": "The inflorescences vary in number and size, from young to older plants, with younger plants only having one, but in older plants, it can form between three and four branches up to 4ft. Each raceme is long and narrow, gradually tapering towards the tip. Flowers can be solitary racemes or somewhat branched. Flowers are tubular in shape, 1.5 inches in length, and flattened downward helping distinguish this aloes from most other non-suckering, stemless South African Aloes. Some specimens are uniform in color while others bicolored, Colors are variable from red to orange to red and yellow, all the way to greenish yellow. The flowers are followed by seed that are carried in oblong, green capsules of approximately 6 mm long and 3 mm in diameter.",
    "origin_history": "The name 'aculeata' means prickly and refers to the presence of the many tuberculate spines on the leaf surfaces. It is found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1 700 m, in rocky areas. Aloe aculeata is naturally distributed throughout certain parts of the Limpopo Province, as well as the extreme northern regions of Mpumalanga. Towards the north, the distribution extends into Zimbabwe.",
    "care_cultivation": "It needs regular watering in summer, but is dormant in winter and needs very little water. This aloe is relatively easy to cultivate under a wide variety of climatic conditions, provided it is planted in a well-drained situation, given adequate water, but not over watered. It can be grown outdoors in raised beds and terraces if sheltered from winter rain. It can also be planted in pots and placed on bright windowsills. When fertilizing, use a light fertilizer specifically formulated for succulents (high potash fertilizer with a dilute low nitrogen), including all micro nutrients and trace elements. Feed them during the growing season. They do very well in poor soils, so a limited amount of fertilizer is in order. When planting in pots, make sure to use relatively shallow pots to accommodate the fibrous roots, and provide very good drainage. It may stay in the same pot for many years. Water it less than average if in bigger pots. It may be grown in full sun too but protect in summer from afternoon sun, and avoid reflected heat. Plants definitely need a lot of sunlight and though shaded plants develop a deep, bright green coloration, this is not normal and these plants are prone to rot, particularly if their crowns get wet. Aloe aculeata prefers light shade to full sun. It will do its best with some sun and become stressed with inadequate light which could result in poor growth and unnatural shape. It enjoys light-shade. Not a good aloe for shady areas, and a bit prone to rot without full sun conditions. Keep dry in winter or when night temperatures remain below 10° C. Nearly all problems occur as a result of overwatering and poor ventilation, especially when weather conditions are dull and cool or very humid. It likes warmth (recommended minimum winter temperature 5° C) however plants kept perfectly dry can can survive low temperatures, approx. -2° for short periods, but for safe cultivation it is best to avoid freezing temperatures.",
    "frost": "Plant is hardy down at least to 20F. Flowers are not nearly as cold tolerant as the plants itself.",
    "use": "It is frost sensitive, but drought-tolerant and is suitable for xeriscaping. The attractive, thorny foliage and colorful flower display makes Aloe aculeata an interesting specimen plant for a dry garden.",

    "aka": ["Coast Aloe", "Dune Aloe"],
    "overview": "Aloe thraskii is wonderful feature plant that is tall and robust, with enormous olive green leaves that are recurved back to the trunk, sometimes even touching the skirt of old, dried leaves around the trunk. This unbranched tree-like Aloe grows to 10 feet with deeply concave (U-shaped in cross section) pale olive-green leaves that have small reddish-brown marginal teeth. Also known as the Dune Aloe this fast-growing, South African, un-branched succulent plant, develops a very large and beautiful rosette.",
    "description": "It is among the tallest aloe species usually about 2 meters tall, Aloe thraskii can reach up to 4 meters with a width of up to two meters. The long, pale, grey-green leaves are deeply grooved or channeled and recurve downwards. Has typical arching, grooved aloe leaves with light green coloration. The long leaves curve strongly downwards, with the tips of the lower leaves touching the stem. Leaves are up to roughly 5ft (160 cm) long and 8inches (22 cm wide), broadly lanceolate, glaucous, sometimes with a few spines on both the upper and lower surfaces. The shaggy remains of old leaves cloak the trunk. Stems are single, robust and usually 2 meters in height but can reach up to 4 meters in older specimens. Spines are sometimes also present in a line down the middle of the lower leaf surface. Margins armed with reddish-brown teeth maturing from initial white teeth on young leaves.",
    "flowering": "In winter the orange and yellow flowers grow in short, compact, cylindrical racemes, on multi-branched inflorescences. Younger plants may only produce a single inflorescences while older ones can produce 3 to 4 inflorescences with 15 to 25 upright broadly-cylindrical erect racemes. Flowers are quite small and yellow in color, the flowers mouth tips are tinged green, stamens protrude from the flowers mouth and are orange in color. The flowers are yellow, with green tinged tips, and the anthers are orange, giving the flowers a bicolored look.",
    "origin_history": "This plant comes from sand dunes along the east coast of South Africa and is best grown in coastal areas. These plants are naturally found along the coast in a very narrow strip, never more than a few hundred metres from the sea. They are always found in groups in the coastal thicket, often as part of the ground layer or sometime in clearings and rocky places. This South African native named by John Gilbert Baker (1834-1920) in 1880 was named for a Mr Thrask, of whom nothing beside his name is known. Aloe thraskii is classed as Near Threatened in its natural habitat due to habitat loss from urban and coastal development and illegal collecting for the specialist succulent horticultural trade. It can also be confused with Aloe vanballenii when young, and Aloes angelica and Aloes alooides as mature plant. It has been given tree status in South Africa.",
    "care_cultivation": "The Dune aloe grows fast in cultivation and is especially suited for coastal situations as it tolerates wind and salt air. It can be grown in inland gardens with mild winters and not overly damp summers. Aloe thraskii grows well in cultivation, where it has proven to be very fast growing, developing a 'trunk' early in life. They are really not very demanding and regular watering in their growing season creates healthy disease resistant plants that will flower better. It should be watered sparingly in the garden and provided with very good ventilation. Nearly all problems occur as a result of overwatering and poor ventilation, especially when weather conditions are dull and cool or very humid. Plant it in full sun and ensure that the soil drains very well, to help prevent fungal infections. During the winter months, the plants should be grown cool to initiate flower development (about 10°C ). Feed it during the growing season with a fertilizer specifically formulated for cactus and succulents (high potash fertilizer with a dilute low nitrogen), including all micro nutrients and trace elements diluted to ½ the strength recommended on the label. Will handle very harsh sunlight, sometimes taking on a coppery leaf sheen, a sign generally associated with stress. Occasionally these plants are infested by scale and aphids, but all known garden pests can be kept to a minimum by simply ensuring optimal growing conditions and healthy plants.",
    "frost": "The dune aloe is tender to frost with cold tolerance to about 25F with some mild leaf damage at that temperature. Aloe thraskii flowers are more frost sensitive than the leaves.",
    "use": "Ideal for planting on slopes, sandy or stony soil. As its name suggests, Coast Aloe is well suited to growing in coastal regions. Flowers attract many bees and birds. Outdoors it grows to astonishing proportions also in areas with wet winters, so don't be afraid to plant this in a high-rainfall area. It can be also cultivated outdoors in raised beds and terraces and is one of the aloes that can form a centre piece in a garden or grouped, creating a magnificent backdrop, if you have the space, to provide form and texture. This wonderful architectural plant will add accent and interest to your garden and will attract nectar and insect eating birds. Plant it as a single specimen or in large groups, for great effect. The dune aloe also grows beautifully in large containers.",

This is a shrubby, fast growing species which can fill an area in a few years, after which it slowly spreads in all directions. Aloe acutissima is generally a smallish, many-stemmed species with spikes of orange to red flowers.",
    "description": "Aloe acutissima spreads out from the center and with time can form a wide, somewhat wildly branching, shrub. A rapid but low grower that reaches 18′ tall with slender stalks and multiple heads. Its stems are topped with 8-10 inch wide rosettes of narrow recurved leaves that have pink-purple and red. The primary leaf color is pale turquoise, with other colors coming about in response to various stresses (heat, cold, drought, sun burn). Its recurved leaves are somewhat narrow and armed on the margins with triangular reddish-brown teeth. Dry weather, heat and cold produce the most vibrant colors.",
    "flowering": "The dull orange-red winter flowers are borne on single spikes which rise a foot above the colored foliage and are attractive to hummingbirds. The foliage is main, attractive feature of this species not the flowers.",
    "origin_history": "The species name means 'very acutely pointed.' This plant grows up to 4000 feet in elevation close to Toliara near the south west coast of Madagascar to Fianarantsoa closer to the center of the island, where it grows on rocks and shallow soils.",
    "care_cultivation": "Aloe acutissima is drought tolerate, grows well in full sun and well-drained soil. Likes water all year round and not prone to rot but requires little irrigation and colors up best when kept dry. Thrives in California’s rich soil with little care and water needed. Remove spent flowers and leaves if desired. It may need cutting back in smaller, well-planned landscapes.",
    "frost": "Cold-tolerant to around 25 °F.",
    "use": "Succulent and cactus gardens, xeriscape plantings, dry borders and rock gardens. Does well in pots too, provided soil drains well. Best when planted in groups of three or more to fully appreciate striking lilac foliage.",

The leaves tend to be broad. The leaves have some mild linear flecking of white and sharp but small spines along the edges. The apex of a leaf often has a pinkish tinge. The lower surface of the leaf is paler and lightly marked. During dry periods the leaf has a twisted dry apex. This aloe is often grouped into the 'maculate' or spotted aloes all stemless, heavily spotted, often suckering plants with open red to orange to yellow inflorescences. The plant is one meter in height. Teeth along the leaf margins are very sharp.",
    "flowering": "Each rosette can produce several branched inflorescences. The inflorescence is a compactly-branched panicle with ten racemes. Lateral racemes are shorter than the terminating racemes, they are densely flowered and are a deep pink or brick-red in color.",
    "origin_history": "The name 'affinis', meaning 'related to' or 'resembling' comes from this plant's relationship to other maculate or spotted aloes, although A. affinis has larger leaves, is unspotted and, unlike much of this group, remains mostly solitary. This aloe is found amongst bushes, grassy slopes, open areas, rocky sandstone, quartzite patches in the summer rainfall areas of the eastern Transvaal (Swaiziland north to Marieps Mountain) where it grows with shrubs and grasses on rocky slopes between 3000-4000 feet where it experiences moderate to warm summer temperatures and light frosts in winter.",

    "overview": "Aloe africana is a handsome aloe native to the Eastern Cape of South Africa which adapts to a wide range of conditions. Although branching specimens are not unheard-of, Aloe africana is normally a single-stemmed plant, with a rosette of waxy, blue-green leaves with reddish spines along the edges reaching a height of up to 13 ft. (4 m). Aloe africana's striking yellow flowers attract bees and hummingbirds from all around.",
    "description": "The plant grows moderately slow and flowers when it is four to five years old. The thin, narrow, recurved, leaves are more messy or disorderly than the neat symmetrical rosettes of other arborescent Aloe species. Each leaf's margins and lower side are armed with lines of small, reddish teeth. The grayish-green leaves crowded in a dense, apical rosette, are 2 feet or so in length (up to 65 cm), spreading outward and then curving downward toward the tapered tips. In shady positions the leaves are greener, and under dry conditions they can take on a purplish or pinkish tinge. Eventually, this 6’ plus tall Aloe will form a trunk under a skirt of desiccating leaves.",
    "flowering": "The plants grow slowly and reach the flowering stage in 4 to 5 years. Bears deep orange buds that open to a light orange or yellow flower. Flowers mostly from mid to late winter, and early spring. The individual flowers are held in a downward inclination but uniquely turn upwards towards the tips. Its large raceme is erect and may be unbranched or have up to four branches, and has tubular flowers. They are are orange in bud and turn yellow just prior to opening from the bottom of the spike upwards. Young plants have flower stalks without branches, but older plants typically have one or more side branches, with exceptional plants having as many as four. These torch-like blooms are attractive to hummingbirds and compliment the grey green leaves, which are armed with many dark thorns.",
    "origin_history": "Aloe africana is native to the summer moist coastal Eastern Cape in South Africa where it grows within thickets of shrubs from sea level to nearly 1,000 feet in elevation. It was described in 1768 by the Scottish botanist Philip Miller, who was also the chief gardener at the Chelsea Physic Garden. It was grown in Europe prior to when many other aloes were described and before Linnaeus establishing the binominal classification system we currently use. The specific epithet that Miller gave it is simply in reference its African origins. The common name Uitenhage Aloe used in South Africa comes from a locality, the Uitenhage District, where this plant is plentiful. The climate is moderate, without frost, and hot and humid during summers. Aloe africana is restricted to the southeastern and southwestern part of South Africa, in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape, and is particularly common near Port Elizabeth, Uitenhage and the lower Gamtoos River. It often grows in association with Aloe ferox, A. pluridens and A. speciosa, and hybrids are not uncommon.",
    "care_cultivation": "Aloe africana prefers full sun in a well-drained sandy, soil. Does very well in milder coastal climate zones, but should be protected from cold snaps in inland locations where the winter lows are more pronounced. Tolerant of hot sun, drought, wind, deer, salt spray and a wide range of soils. Over-watering can cause fungal infections. It thrives in a wide range of soil and even grows well in the winter rainfall Western Cape gardens where it should preferably be moistened during the dry summer months. The plants are fairly pest free, but may occasionally be attacked by the aloe snout weevil.",
    "frost": "Cold hardiness is slightly better than average. Aloe africana very rarely experiences below-freezing temperatures in its habitat, but in cultivation it can withstand cold spells down to the mid-twenties F (-4° C) as long as this is not sustained. In cold weather the leaves are tinged with red.",
    "use": "A single-headed species which develops a trunk and can be used as a focal point like a small tree aloe and underplanted with other succulents. Keep it back from the path as the teeth are sharp and catch clothing and cut the skin but in flower it is sensational and also very attractive to bees and hummingbirds. Aloe africana thrives in coastal gardens but also as a pot or container plant. The plants prefer full sun and windy conditions. They are tolerant towards other plant species and often share their habitat with smaller succulent plants. Plants will benefit from compost or any organic feeding.",

    "description": "The single usually unbranched stem can be as much as 7 feet tall and the mature leaves are long, strongly recurved, and armed with reddish-brown teeth. The old leaves create a grass hula skirt or they can be cleaned off the trunk to accent the green tops. Leaves are green in color and can have a reddish tinge in times of drought. Aloe alooides is distinguished by its nearly thornless leaves and strongly recurved, so much so that they may actually touch the stem.",
    "flowering": "Aloe alooides has beautiful upright 3 foot flower spikes of green buds open in winter to a nice bright yellow that matures to an orangey-brown. Up to five single racemes of small, bell-shaped flowers may grow in season from the leaf rosette of a thriving plant. The nectar inside the flowers is loved by birds & bees.",
    "origin_history": "Ironically the specie name 'alooides' means 'resembling an aloe' because it was originally in a different genus. The common Afrikaans name is Graskopaalwyn which means Grass Head Aloe when directly translated. It comes from a very restricted habitat in the mountains of Mpumalanga Province in South Africa, growing from 4000-6000 feet in altitude, in shallow soil on dolomite ridges. Although range restricted, the species is not considered to be threatened in its habitat.",

It is a large, single-stemmed plant, 3–4 meters (10 - 13 feet) in height, with green, succulent leaves, bent backward, and red-budded flowers in compact bunches on much-branched racemes, turning yellow as they flower.",
    "description": "Aloe angelica may be confused with other South African tree aloes like A thraskii or A alooides when it is not in flower, which also have long, tapering smooth leaves. Stems usually solitary but they may branch occasionally. Plants can be up to 4 meters in height, stems are long, slender and smooth, dry leaves cover the upper half of stems. Leaves near the top of the rosette is spread out while leaves near the bottom of the rosette are strongly recurved. Leaf surfaces of Aloe angelica are smooth while the leaf margins are armed with small sharp teeth. This species is harder to find than Aloe thraskii.",
    "flowering": "Inflorescences are complex and may be branched up to twenty times, racemes are short and round. The complex much-branched inflorescence contains many short tubular flowers budding red but turning yellow in age. The flowers are just super in mid-winter, opening to 10 - 20 short round racemes.",

    "description": "Aloe branddraaiensis forms a simple rosette bearing light green leaves spotted and marked with white striations. Zigzaggedly striped leaves are protected by sharp marginal reddish-brown or orange-brown spines. Sometimes plants are single-headed, but often they have a few offshoots at the base. The leaves are up to 14 inches long (35 cm) and 4 inches wide (10 cm), with whitish spots peppering the surface. In shade, the leaf color is deep green, but with increasing light levels plants acquire a purple or reddish tinge. Often the spots are arranged in undulating bands across the leaf surface, but this is not always the case. It is a slow to moderate grower with no particular problems relative to the other spotted aloes. It rarely exceeds 30 cm (12 inches) in height excluding inflorescences, often suckering it form small clumps.",
    "flowering": "On full-grown plants, two or three flower stalks are produced from a single rosette in one flowering season. The inflorescences of this species are highly branched and covered with brilliant red flower racemes making it one of the more ornamental of this myriad of spotted aloes. Each flower has a rounded base, narrowing a little above this, and then increasing again in diameter toward the mouth.",

The racemes are cone-shaped and rather sparse lower down, but with the buds densely packed and hidden by the bracts. The flowers of all the species in this group are large in relation to the size of the plants and therefore very showy, which makes them highly sought-after collectors' items.",
    "origin_history": "This plant has a restricted natural distribution on dry clay soil in mild winter rainfall areas near the coast and up to 500 feet in elevation in the Western Cape Province of South Africa. Its natural habitat is critically endangered because of the areas transformation to agriculture. The name 'brevifolia' means 'short-leaf' in Latin.",

    "description": "Aloe broomii comes in two distinct varieties, the common form and var. tarkaensis. Snake Aloe is usually solitary, but occasionally the heads divide to form groups of up to 3 rosettes. The plant may form a huge perfect rosette up to 1 m across of yellowish-green, faintly lineate leaves. The leaves are light green and are arranged in a dense rosette. The leaves are adorned with reddish brown, deltoid, teeth along the edges, which curl interestingly along the outer edges of each leaf. These thorns are very dark, compared to other species whose thorns are either green or white. It grows up to 1.5 metres high, including the inflorescence. When Aloe broomii grows with other species of Aloe which flower at the same time, natural hybrids are usually found. This is one of the most dangerous aloes to stick your hand into the middle of (like when removing debris from between the leaves) because of hooked sharp spines. Rarely suckers.",
    "flowering": "The most notable feature of this plant is its odd inflorescence, where the flowers are hidden by the extended bracts, giving it a sinuous, snake-like appearance, hence its name. The flowers are pale greenish yellow and 20 - 25 mm long. It flowers during late winter to spring, and the seed ripens during summer. This Aloe develops a stunning, densely flowered, candle-like inflorescence, 4-5 ft. tall (120-150 cm), in which the buds and pale lemon flowers are covered by white long bracts.",
    "origin_history": "It is found on rocky slopes in hilly parts of the central interior of southern Africa at altitudes of 1000-2000 m, from the top of the southern escarpment near Beaufort West in the Northern Cape, to near Tarkastad in the Eastern Cape to the Free State in the north, and in Lesotho. Aloe broomii was collected by Dr R. Broom in 1905 at Pampoenpoort, which is between Carnarvon and Victoria West, so this wonderful species was named after the man who was the first to collect it. It earned the common name snake aloe because of its long, slender, snake-like inflorescence. Aloe broomii is depicted in 250-year old rock paintings in South Africa.",
    "care_cultivation": "Grow Aloe broomii in a sunny position in well-drained (sandy), fertile, soil. Add plenty of compost and bone meal to the planting hole and give the newly planted aloe a regular deep watering for the first few weeks - this will encourage strong root growth. Add a thick mulch of compost to both feed the plant and keep the roots cool. Mulch will also reduce evaporation and decrease weed growth. As the plant gets established, reduce the amount of water and don't water at all during the rainy season.",
    "frost": "",
    "use": "Aloe broomii is an ideal water-wise plant, especially in arid and semi-arid regions, and it is frost resistant. It makes an excellent focal point and structural plant in landscaped gardens, and is a good choice for a rock garden.",

    "description": "Aloe burgersfortensis is a very variable plant, though probably due mostly to different environmental conditions. Grows up to 20-40 cm tall excluding inflorescence. It has brownish leaves with dry twisted tips, branched inflorescence of dull red flowers with whitish bloom. Plants are generally stemless, but may in time develop a short, erect or creeping stem. The rosette is more or less compact with approximatively 10-15 decurved to spreading widely leaves giving the rosette a flattened appearance. The leaves are white spotted on a green-gray background, and the flowers are multicolored with mostly red tubes with white striping. In this species the leaf sap usually dries deep purple to violet, but exceptional specimens with sap drying golden yellow are known. Marginal teeth 1/4 inch to 3/8 inch long, semi-sharp, brown tipped. Individual leaves average 12 to 18 inches long, 1-1/2 to 3 inches broad toward the base, lanceolate-attenuate, but variable in shape and ranging from comparatively short, erect and triangular to fairly long and twisted, slightly channeled. The waxy leaves have sunken pores that prevent water loss.",

    "aka": ["Red Aloe"],
    "overview": "Aloe cameronii (Red Aloe) is a medium-sized suckering aloe with many upright stems of open rosettes to 1 to 2 feet with narrow leaves that are medium to dark green and that turn a beautiful coppery red in summer. Regarded as one of the most attractive foliage Aloes and also bears attractive flowers.",
    "description": "The fleshy, gracefully curving leaves are a rainbow of colors ranging from green to a rich coppery red, depending on sun and water. This medium-sized aloe suckers readily with many upright stems and grows in open rosettes one to two feet in diameter. The leaves turn a beautiful coppery red in sunny weather and drought. Red Aloe gets its name from its attractive foliage colors - the curving leaves can range from green to copper to a deep red wine. Its narrow leaves turn deep red when grown in full sun and high heat.",
    "flowering": "Aloe cameronii’s bright orange-red flowers emerge in 1 foot tall spikes from late fall through the winter. While the flowers are truly beautiful, they are even more attractive in contrast with the deep red of Aloe cameronii leaves. The flowers produce nectar and are attractive to birds and bees.",
    "origin_history": "It was first discovered in the central African country of Nyasaland (now Malawi) by Kenneth J. Cameron, an employee of the African Lakes Corporation, who first sent it to the Royal Botanic Garden at Kew in 1854 but was not described until it flowered there in 1903 when William Botting Hemsley (1843-1924), longtime gardener and keeper at Kew, was able to fully describe it though the original collection data was lost or not recorded.",
    "care_cultivation": "Plant in full sun in a well-drained soil and irrigate only occasionally to enhance the red coloration of the foliage, which will remain bright apple-green if overwatered. Virtually disease free. Watch for scale insects and mealybugs.",
    "frost": "Aloe cameronii is a relatively hardy plant, handling down to the mid 20's without frost damage.",
    "use": "This aloe makes a nice specimen planting and provides a striking foliage color contrast in the succulent garden. Aloe cameronii is great for beds and borders, rock gardens, succulent gardens or Mediterranean gardens. This plant makes a handsome container plant when young. Leaves are brittle and can easily be broken so plan plant's location accordingly. Good for attracting nectar loving birds and insects when in bloom. This Aloe provides a colorful focal point in the xeriscape. Deer resistant.",

    "description": "Aloe camperi (Aloe grenadensis) is a clump forming Aloe that will eventually form a average clump of 3' to 4' feet spread and 2' to 3' feet tall. The toothy edges are soft to the touch, and user friendly, on long, strap-like, slightly recurving leaves. These aloes have a short stem and reach 24-36 inches (60-91 cm) in height and up to 24 inches (60 cm) around. Leaves are dark green, with white flecks near the stem on the leaf undersides. Shades of green with lighter colored striations make the leaves of Camperi very picturesque. Allowed time in the sun the leaves will change to shades of pinkish-red on this stemless rather large sized aloe. Popcorn Aloe blooms later in the season than most Aloes, so it is a nice extension of the flowering season going more into the spring than other Aloes which tend to be winter bloomers. The plant suckers to form clumps of stems. Aloe camperi is a heavy offset producer.",
    "flowering": "An established colony of Aloe camperi in full bloom is truly a thing of beauty! 'Popcorn Aloe' blooms later in the season than most Aloes, so it is a nice extension of the flowering season going more into the spring than other Aloes which tend to be winter bloomers. This plant reliably produces 3 foot tall branched inflorescences with an abundance of salmon-orange buds that open to yellow flowers from the bottom up. The flowers are unique as they tend to be less tubular, and a little bit more puffy in a beautiful, soft apricot color. Flower stems are slightly candelabra, and arise above the plants by about 1.5 ft.",
    "origin_history": "Aloe camperi is from Eretria in northeastern Africa south to Ethiopia at elevations ranging from 4,600 feet to 8,300 feet and was first described using this name in 1891 by Georg Schweinfurth, a German who lived in Riga in the Baltic Provinces of Russia, from a plant collected at about 4,600 feet in the Great Valley above Ghinda in Eritrea. Schweinfurth named Aloe camperi for his friend Manfedo Camperio, an Italian born resident of Eritrea.",

    "description": "In mid-winter appear the up to 3 foot tall inflorescences top with dense 4 inch long spherical capitate racemes of orange buds on reddish pedicles that open to display orange-yellow 1 inch long narrow bell shaped flowers that open first from near the top. The fleshy tapered leaves can grow up to 2' across and are a milky blue-gray color under less sunny conditions, becoming purple-tinged with stronger sun. They are lined with small, triangular, dark red teeth. This single-headed plant has stemless rosettes to 2 feet across (.6 m).",
    "flowering": "The plant is striking even without any flowers, but the flowers are a fantastic addition, having a vivid orange color as buds, turning to yellow when they open. Each branch is topped with a rounded head of flowers, tubular at the bud stage and widening at the mouth when they open to become narrowly bell-shaped. Unlike most other species of Aloe, this one’s flowers do not necessarily open in sequence from bottom to top, often starting somewhere in between. The long pedicels (the stalks of the individual flowers) are reddish. The rounded heads of flowers look like pom-poms.",

    "description": "Aloe castanea can grow into a small tree (8 to 12 feet tall) with a single main trunk at ground level with several spreading branches higher up or can be pruned to enhance lower branching to form a dense shrub-like mass 6 to 10 feet tall. The leaves are up to 150cm (5 feet) long with the older leaves persisting along the trunk providing a 'skirt' with the margins armed with firm, small, brown teeth. Leaves tend to rise up like the tail of a cat. Leaves are usually bluish-green and generally upright with a slight curve inward and sharp, hooked yellowish teeth with brown tips. The rosette gives rise to multiple, fuzzy, orange racemes. Usually branching near the base or above.",
    "flowering": "The blooms, which appear in mid-winter, are an unusual color of dark orange-brown and are formed along the curled and snake-like inflorescence, hence the common name Cat's Tail Aloe. The nectar of this plant is an unusual brown color. Multiple heads in bloom can be quite striking. The flowers themselves all align along the upside of the rachis/peduncle slanting outward away from the plant. This plant is not a always a reliable flowerer and tends to need full sun to flower well (too much shade and flowers often do not matieralize for years). The inflorescence develops during winter as an unbranched, densely flowered spike with short, reddish brown, bell-like flowers with protruding stamens.",
    "origin_history": "It is a native of South Africa, and more specifically of what used to be called the Northern Province of South Africa which is now called Limpopo. The specific epithet 'castanea' is the Latin word for 'chestnut' in reference to this aloe's brownish colored flowers.",
    "care_cultivation": "This Aloe is drought tolerant but it blooms better if given some water in the Summer, but it does need good drainage. If they are grown outdoors in warm climates, they should be planted in full sun, or light shade. Also, surprisingly, this Aloe prefers rich soil. Adding a layer of compost every year is a good thing. Established plants will survive a drought quite well. If you live in a more temperate area it's best to leave your Aloe plant in a pot, indoors and place it near a window that gets a lot of sun. You can move the pot outdoors during the summer months. The height and spread can be manipulated greatly if the plant is appropriately pruned from a young age.",
    "frost": "Can take a tiny bit more cold than the average South African aloe. Hardy to minus 5°C (22°F) it withstands moderate frost, but is normally grown as a potted plant, indoors or on the summer patio. Brian Kemble of the Ruth Bancroft garden lists it as hardy to 20° F on his List of Hardy Aloes.",

    "description": "Aloe chabaudii is a clustering aloe that can form large groups with neat rosettes to 2 feet tall of up to 30 bluish green leaves that are often flushed with pink when grown in full sun. In a compact spiralled rosette at the stem apex in old plants, but in juvenile plants they are ranked in vertical rows. Plants are stemless even in mature specimens, many suckers are produced. Aloe chabaudii leaves are broad, tapering, lanceolate-attenuate, without spots, pale grey-green to blue-turquoise, which in full sun and in winter can take a pinkish-red tinge. Young plants may have white spots on the leaves which disappear at maturity. The leaf margins with small pungent, deltoid teeth. Plants generally form one of two alternate colors: blue/grey-green, often flushed with pink, or reddish/pink. Dwala Aloe when grown in shaded woodland are often larger, with dark olive-green leaves, and a taller more expanded inflorescence.",
    "flowering": "Aloe chabaudii flowering occurs mainly in winter and is a showy, prolific display of orange-red flowers held in branched racemes. Individual flowers are tubular and sought after by nectar loving birds and insects. The inflorescence is a 50 - 100 cm (1 ½ to 3 feet) tall multi-branched panicle with up to 15 densely flowered racemes. Flowers are small of coral pink or red at tip of each branch.",
    "origin_history": "Named after John A. Chabaud, an enthusiastic amateur gardener in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, in whose garden the original specimens flowered. Aloe chabuadii can be found in the Northern Province, Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal provinces of South Africa. It extends into Tanzania, Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Swasiland. The common name sometimes given this plant is Dwala Aloe for its typical habitat - a dwala is a word used to describe a large unbroken dome of granite in Zimbabwe but it is also called Chabaud's Aloe.",
    "care_cultivation": "Aloe chabaudii is tolerant of a wide range of habitats, from dry, exposed granite slopes to shady wooded slopes, or even vertical cliffs drenched in spray from waterfalls. This plant originates in a summer rainfall area and appreciates additional water in summer. A perennial succulent is heat and cold-tolerant, adaptable to sun or shade, in well-drained soil. Stress from poor drainage can make the plant more prone to pest problems as well as rots. It can take full sun along the coast as well.",
    "frost": "Plants can tolerate frosts with temperatures down to around to 25°F for short durations and may prove hardier.",
    "use": "In mild climates it can be cultivated outdoors for use in landscaping, preferably planting it in hot and dry rock gardens. Aloe chabaudii is one of the more strikingly colored aloes and grows attractively in a garden with other succulents and sun-loving cycads. It makes an excellent ground cover, grows best in a sunny position and makes a long lasting cut flower. Works fine as a container plant, especially in a wide bowl style of planter which allows the plant to offset and multiply. Aloe chabaudii could be interesting massed with additional containers of larger leaved aloes which bloom at different times to extend the bloom season.",

    "title": "Aloe ciliaris",

    "aka": ["Climbing Aloe", "Aloiampelos ciliaris"],
    "overview": "Aloiampelos ciliaris, formerly known as Aloe ciliaris, (also known as the 'Climbing Aloe') is a thin, tough, rapidly growing succulent plant with many long semi-woody stems to 30 feet long that tend to scramble upward, often spiralling as it climbs. The Climbing Aloe is native to South Africa and is said to be the fastest growing of all Aloes.",
    "description": "Aloe ciliarus grows very quickly, producing long, thin, untidy stems that shoot upwards, producing large, bright orange-red flowers once they reach the sun. It can be differentiated from other Aloiampelos species by the way that the soft, white, hair-like teeth (ciliaris), that grow along the margins of the leaves, extend all the way around the stem, at the base of the leaf. Their recurved, leathery leaves act as hooks, allowing the plant to anchor itself in the thick vegetation. The leaf sheaths are conspicuously striped green and white. The rather soft leaves are arranged spirally, and are mostly crowded at the ends of the branches. If there are no nearby trees to act as host and support, it just forms a straggly shrub. This is the fastest growing of all aloes and their relatives. It can reach 8 to 12 feet in height and needs the support of another plant or a trellis for climbing. Roots are shallow, fleshy and about 5 mm in diameter, radiating from the swollen base. Stems lying on the ground will root.",
    "flowering": "Bright orange tubular flowers on tall spikes appear almost throughout the year but with a peak in late winter and early spring. The unbranched 6-12 inch long inflorescences rise vertically from near the tips of the branches and bare inch long tubular flowers with yellow tips that dangle downwards. Flowers are interesting as they are bright yellow inside, but orange outside. The oblong fruiting capsule is about 18 mm (3/4 inch) long.",
    "origin_history": "While Aloiampelos ciliaris was originally indigenous to the dry thicket vegetation of the South African Eastern Cape, this adaptable species has been widely introduced and currently occurs across much of South Africa. The name 'ciliaris' pertains to its marginal teeth arranged like an eyelash and extending right around the base of the leaf. Aloe ciliaris var. ciliaris was first collected in 1813 in the Port Alfred District by William John Burchell (1781-1863), a British explorer and naturalist, and was named by the British botanist Adrian Hardy Haworth (1767-1833) in 1825. Introduced into cultivation in 1821 by Kew botanist and plant collector James Bowie (1789-1869). It was introduced into cultivation in Santa Barbara, California in 1908 by Dr. Francesco Franceschi.",
    "care_cultivation": "The Climbing Aloe prefers full sun, and like most succulents is drought tolerant but Aloe ciliaris will also grow well in high rainfall regions, where they should be planted in a well-drained spot. Easy to control, so wouldn't actually say it's invasive, but it can cover other stuff up if you let it. It is not shy to flower and thrives on organic food such as compost. A. ciliaris is more lush and green with irrigation but plants in un-irrigated sites take on a nice chocolate brown color. They grow very easily from cuttings.",
    "frost": "Protect from frost. Aloe ciliaris is not considered to be a very cold tolerant but it has survived temps to the upper 20's F. When damaged by heavier frost it melts in a dramatic fashion.",
    "use": "This is a great aloe used as a rambling ground-cover or as a vine with some support - very nice running up a large palm. Makes a good hedge. It is best planted at the base of a shrubbery or fence. It will soon climb to the canopy and produce its handsome flowers. It also thrives in containers, but needs support for its weak stems. If given space and time, stems lying on the ground will root and a rounded mound will form. Outdoors in its native South African climate it will branch and climb like a vine, growing into a medium-sized shrub, Aloe ciliaris will, however, stay small in a pot if grown indoors.",

    "description": "Classen's Aloe will grow and flower in considerable shade but has more interesting foliage colors when in full sun. The foliage is perhaps more colorful, as it can blush reddish when in full sun and given no water and exposed to some cold, such as where it grows in nature on low granite domes which are isolated in bushland along the Kenya – Tanzania border. It has a solitary rosette bearing numerous brownish-green leaves with brown marginal spines.",

    "origin_history": "It is found in nature only on rocky outcrops in dry bushland around 2,000 feet in southeastern Kenya, near the border with Tanzania. The name honors Russia born geologist George A. Classen who in settled in Nairobi Kenya and collected plants during his travels. Gilbert Westacott Reynolds named the plant for Classen in gratitude for help providing plants, data and photographs of this species and others. George Classen (1915 – 1982) was born in Russia and settled in Nairobi, Kenya. He botanized southern Kenya during the 1960s and 1970s while travelling professionally as a hydrologist, bringing a number of new succulent taxa (aloes, euphorbias, etc.) to the attention of botanists who subsequently described them as new to science. From southeastern Kenya, this species appears to be restricted to granitic domes at low elevations.",

    "aka": ["Kraal aloe", "Jackal's tail aloe"],
    "overview": "Widely distributed in desert regions of southern Africa, this mid-sized, stemless, clustering Aloe is easily recognized by its upright, pale bluish leaves and the horizontally held, unbranched inflorescence with red flowers.",
    "description": "Aloe claviflora grows stemless or short stemmed chalky blue-grey rosettes 18” wide & high pop out babies that form a circular pattern, kind of like a camp fire ring. Plants are normally stemless but in old specimens, short stems may form which grow horizontally along the ground. Unlike other typical Aloes in arid areas, it does not have erect rosettes. Instead they face outward, giving them a characteristically asymmetric shape. The plant in itself is very tough and can survive often for several seasons without water, at which point the leaves turn a whitish color to help reflect the sun away from the plant. The leaves also close inwardly to form tough round balls that effectively protect the young leaves from heat stress. Leaves slight rough in texture, thick, stiff and brittle, and strikingly pale green to grey-green with sparse, black marginal teeth. There are also some spines along the middle of the lower surface of the leaf which extend toward the leaf apex.",
    "flowering": "Aloe claviflora produces cool club shaped, orangey-coral hued 12” long flowers that attract pollinators emerge horizontally at an angle rather than upright putting on a spectacular bloomy show in Spring. The buds and young flowers are bright red but turn a yellow and whitish color as they age with time. This gives a very attractive bicolored appearance to the racemes. For some reason the blooms all point out away from the center of the cluster. Aloe claviflora produces nectar and is therefore pollinated by birds as well as winged and crawling insects such as ants which are small enough to enter the flower tube in which the nectar is stored.",
    "origin_history": "Aloe claviflora is found in the extremely arid areas of South Africa's interior in habitats ranging from flat stony ground, well-drained sandy expanses and raised rocky outcrops and hills. The specific epithet claviflora means club-shaped, referring to the flowers and is aptly chosen. Aloe claviflora was first recorded in Burchell's Travels in the interior of southern Africa in 1811. Populations are normally found to be healthy and may occur in quite dense stands especially in the south where they blend in well with the Namaqualand scrubland.",
    "care_cultivation": "Aloe claviflora grows relatively easily in cultivation if not overwatered and is grown in a sunny spot. It’s also easy to grow in a container if your drainage isn’t great. This species is readily prone to rot if allowed to get too wet in summer, or wet AND cold in winter. Small plants that still have fat, thick leaves clustered together are particularly prone to leaf rot, so best to grow seedlings in protected pots up to a size at which point the leaves start to separate a bit.",
    "frost": "Larger plants are quite cold hardy as long as they stay dry. Reportedly unaffected by temps into the high 20s.",
    "use": "Perfect for the dry tropical or warm temperate garden in USDA Zones 9 and above. Artificially, a smallish rock garden that provides some shelter for A. claviflora, provides the best growing conditions but only in low rainfall areas. It can easily be transplanted and grows well in containers. It is a smaller plant but unique enough to still be a specimen in a smaller garden.",

    "overview": "Aloe comptonii is one of the larger creeping aloe species from S. Africa. This species is a moderately-sized (the largest of the species), compact, South African aloe known for its growth habit of spreading along the ground via horizontal, sprawling stems, sometimes retaining a lot of leaves giving the rosettes a curious stacked look.",
    "description": "Aloe comptonii is nice looking very turquoise plant, but crawls all over the place leaving a long, sort of messy looking stem in it's wake. This Aloe forms a rosette of blue-green leaves that get to be about 20” wide. Aloe comptonii leaves are up to 300mm in length, narrow and triangular in shape, small sharp white teeth are present on leaf-margins. Leaves are thick and vary from deep green to pinkish brown depending upon sunlight and water exposure. As the plant gets older it will develop a creeping stem about 3’ long that gives the plant a very lazy, laid back appearance as it trails along the ground.",
    "flowering": "The inflorescences of Aloe comptonii are branched into multiple racemes that usually number from three to eight. The flower head is compact & has a spiky, fireworks burst look to it as the individual flowers develop. Flowers are red in color, thin in shape and pendulous. Flowers are highly ornamental, colored orbs of spikes that look like an anemone or sea urchin. Blooms in late Spring or early Summer.",
    "origin_history": "Native to South Africa. Aloe comptonii was named after the second director of the National botanical gardens of South Africa, Professor R.H. Compton. Aloe comptonii has a large distribution area, from Montague in the Western Cape to Uitenhage in the Eastern Cape.",

    "overview": "Aloe congolensis is a small clustering aloe to 6 to 8 inches tall with tight 5 inch wide rosettes on stems that lie along the ground to 2 feet long with short bright green shiny wedge-shaped leaves that have a slight recurved tip and sharp teeth. Leaves take on a reddish-brown cast when drought or cold stressed.",
    "description": "Aloe congolensis is a bright green, shiny aloe with smallish rosettes (6 inches across at the most) of stiff, unbendable (or they fracture) plastic-like leaves with exceptionally large teeth. It grows from tightly-spaced 5 inch rosettes of triangular leaves on stems which lie across the ground. In drought and other times of stress the leaves take on a reddish brown cast. When dry, leaves almost disappear completely (semideciduous) leaving only flowers and a bulb. Plants grow on sprawling stems and each stem retains many leaves (if watered well, which this plant sure seems to like being), sometimes for several feet or more. The leaves are heavily armed with large, sharp teeth the same color as the leaves. It is an aggressive offsetter, and a good grower, and will eventually take over an area, though it is a low growing species.",
    "flowering": "The Congo Aloe blooms in late fall to winter on solitary (unbranched) racemes which rise about a foot above the leaves. The peach-orange colored flowers come when the plant is more mature and in full sun. Without enough sunlight, plants seem resistant to flower. It seems to take the plant years to mature enough to get to flowering size.",
    "origin_history": "Is it a species? a hybrid? No one knows for sure, but the name suggests it comes from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The name Aloe congolensis is not a verified species name but this plant has long been offered and passed around under this name which was first used in 1899.",
    "care_cultivation": "Plant Aloe congolensis in full sun (for best color) to light shade and irrigate occasionally. This plant was particularly prone to aloe mite damage. The leaves are armed with sharp teeth so use care when pruning back.",
    "frost": "This aloe needs protection from hard frosts. Hardy to 28 to 30 F. This is one of the top wimps when it comes to cold sensitivity.",
    "use": "Being a prolific offsetting plant it will eventually cover an area, especially if offsets are removed and replanted nearby. Attractive in rock gardens, succulent and cactus gardens and useful in xeriscape plantings as well. Also works well as a succulent container plant and in hanging baskets where long offsetting branches droop ornamentally. It is deer resistant.",

This is a grassland specie with light green leaves and attractive, unbranched flower spikes with flowers that can vary from whitish to pink.",
    "description": "Aloe cooperi forms offsets freely, has thin, v-shaped leaves that are held in a fan shape and are evergreen in milder climates. The leaves are often yellowish green with the upper surface usually unspotted, though occasionally they have a few white spots lower down. In cold climates they die back in winter and for this reason it is also regarded as a good waterwise garden plant as it needs no watering in winter. The leaves are edged with a row of tiny white bumps. Eventually older plants can lose the distichous leaf pattern and grow in a normal swirl, but still very upright. It forms one or a small clump of rosettes of erect, grass-like leaves that are 60 - 80cm long.",
    "flowering": "The terminal flower spikes emerge in Summer, growing to 3’ tall and bear incredibly attractive flower heads to  1.5” across, green tipped with dangling coral-orange blooms. The inflorescence is simple and bold. The flowers are rich in nectar and are frequently visited by insects and birds.",
    "origin_history": "Aloe cooperi hails from the dry, open grasslands in the Natal Mountains of South Africa where it was discovered in 1860. The leaves and flowers are eaten by the Zulu people. It is also used traditionally to ease birth. Both the young shoots and flowers are edible and considered a delicacy where they grow wild.",

    "aka": ["Aloidendron dichotomum", "Aloe dichotoma", "Quiver Tree", "Kokerboom"],
    "overview": "The beautiful & distinctive Aloidendron dichotomum (Aloe dichotoma) is one of the largest Aloes and is a well known, common garden feature in South Africa. Aloidendron dichotomum is an extremely tough tree that may reach an age of over 80 years and a height of approximately 7 metres. The tree is found in very dry habitats in Namibia and South Africa and provides food and shelter for many insects, mammals and birds. Elegantly tapered branches are topped by succulent rosettes of aloe leaves, with butter yellow flowers produced in winter.",
    "description": "Aloe dichotoma is probably the best known aloe that form an extremely tough tree with densely rounded crown as a result of the repeatedly forked branches. It is one of the biggest members of the genus Aloe and may reach an age of over 80 years and a height of approximately 7(-9) metres with up to 1 m of diameter at ground level. Being one of the only tree forms in its arid habitat, Aloe dichotoma oftentimes plays host to huge colonial nests of social weaver birds. As the trunk grows it becomes swollen, and develops a rich character by forming fissures, and various color appear which give the appearance of great age and strength. The plant forms a flaring trunk covered in a gold/brown bark that, with maturity, peels off in segments. Bark is smooth with sharp scales, coated in a white powdery substance, not real wood (instead more fibrous, soft tissues used) The branches are smooth & covered with a thin layer of whitish powder to deflect the sun’s rays. The rosettes of Aloe dichotomaat form the tips of the forked branches usually create a dense, rounded crown. Leaves of Aloe dichotoma have a bluish color with teeth along the margins, about 1ft long and narrow. In this species the old dry leaves drop off so that the leafy rosettes only remain at the tips of the branches, leaving the rest of their length clean. Leaves are arranged in a spiralled terminal rosette in old plants, but in juvenile plants they are ranked in vertical rows. Aloe dichotoma is usually found growing singly but in some areas the plants grow in large groups, giving the effect of a forest. Quiver Trees have been known to live for several hundred years.",
    "flowering": "The bright yellow flowers are borne in winter. Aloe dichotoma have their first flowers when they are about 20 to 30 years old. The flowers are branch panicles up to 30 cm tall from the base of the peduncle to the apex of the terminal of the raceme. They are bright canary yellow, held close to the leaves, at the tips of the branches, and are fairly short and carried erect. The flowers are rather short and rounded in shape and not nearly as showy as many other species of aloes. The young flower buds can be eaten and have a similar appearance and taste to asparagus. The flowers are bright yellow, tubular and about 1in long with orange stamens protruding from the mouth. The copious nectar of its blossoms draws birds and insects as well as baboons that can strip a tree of its flowers in a short time.",
    "origin_history": "The name, 'dichotoma', means 'divided in two' and refers to the way the branches divide, repeatedly forking in two. It occurs in desert and semi-desert rocky areas where it receives rainfall, if at all, in the winter. Aloidendron dichotomum  mostly occurs in black rock formations (called 'ysterklip') which absorbs a lot of heat during the hot summer. The English name, Quiver tree, refers to the use of its hollowed branches by the San people to make quivers for their arrows. The tree is said to hold the spirits of people who have died without proper burial. This species is a conspicuous component of the arid parts generally known as Namaqualand and Bushmanland. The roots are made into a tea for treating asthma, cough and TB.",
    "care_cultivation": "Aloe dichotoma prefers dry, rocky soil and full sun to part shade, and can be readily grown as a potted specimen. Always use a good quality, loamy sandy soil with plenty of drainage chips at the bottom of containers. It prefers soil of a medium or slightly acidic pH. It grows in semi-desert and desert areas. It seems to grow mostly on hills and their slopes. Young plants will appreciate some shade. One must be careful not to over water older plants in the summer months. Younger plants seem to do just fine with summer water. The growth rate in the ground is amazing. It grows slowly, being able to increase its height by 10-20 cm per year under favorable conditions.",
    "frost": "The quiver tree is proof against frost. Hardy to 23 degrees F & it’s said to be a good idea to wrap its trunk below 28 degrees F.",
    "use": "In mild climates it can be cultivated outdoors for use in landscaping, preferably planting it in hot and dry rock gardens. It can be grown in large containers too. The rocks anchor the plants which have a spread-root-system.",

Also known as the 'Sunset Aloe' it is vigorous, clumping succulent that produces lots of offsets around its base on short stems to 10 inches that lie flat to the ground. Reaching 2' wide by 1' tall after about two years of growth.",
    "description": "A smaller clumping aloe, growing to just over a foot tall. Virtually stemless or very shortly stemmed. In a spiralled rosette, tapering, lanceolate, recurving, that in time of drought it tends to curl in on themself. The stiff, glossy leaves are colored lime green to bright orange red often with some white spotting when young and conspicuous spines along the margins. It has a green base color, but will flush a bright, glossy red when moderately stressed by full sun, drought. Color is best in full sun. The leaves in younger plants tend to have numerous elongated white spots scattered on the smooth surface, but these seem to fade with age.",
    "flowering": "In mid to late winter to early spring a 1 to 2 foot flower spike (usually unbranched) rises above the foliage with dark flower buds that have green at the tips and open to show salmon-orange colored flowers with greenish-yellow tipped petals. Flowering times vary and some plants flower multiple times throughout the year.",
    "origin_history": "Aloe dorotheae is native to northeastern Tanzania, where it is found on rocky ground above 600 m and is critically endangered by habitat loss to agriculture. Found originally near the south bank of the Pangani River and transferred as a live plant in 1890 to the Royal Botanic Garden in Berlin where it was described by Alwin Berger, who noted that the name honored a Miss Dorthy Westhead of London.",
    "care_cultivation": "Plant in full sun to light shade (color much better in sun) and water occasionally to very little. Easy to grow, requiring very little care. It tolerates weekly watering in the summer; once a month, or not at all in the colder months of December and January. Can withstand long periods of drought, but they will thrive and flower more profusely if watered in the correct season. Incorrect watering, poor drainage or too much shade can lead to attack by pests and diseases. This is a very aggressive and easy to grow aloe in clay soils, or more well draining ones. Very easy to grow from cuttings.",
    "frost": "There are various reports on hardiness but it seems that this aloe should be listed as hardy no lower than 28°F and possibly slightly higher.",
    "use": "In mild climates Aloe dorotheae can be cultivated outdoors for use in landscaping, preferably planting it in hot and dry rock gardens. Excellent on patio or as landscape or rock garden subject. This is a great aloe for rocky, exposed areas of the garden where you want some non-green color. Excellent for massing in water-wise garden beds. Great accent or large container specimen. A striking splash of color in the drought tolerant garden.",

A midsized Aloe to 6 feet tall or more with its stem topped by a rosette to about 2 feet wide and amazingly long-lasting bloom spikes.",
    "description": "Aloe 'Erik the Red' can grow to a height of 2 meters (6+ feet) with a width of 1 meter (3+ feet). The main stem often has new shoots in younger plants to create a full shrubby plant but older stems are more solitary. The leaves are green with a prominent spiny edge, a fitting foil for the glowing color of the flowers. It displays prominent, soft and not dangerous, spines on its long large leaves. When the rosette divides as the plant matures, this will enhance the flowering performance.",
    "flowering": "The tall branching inflorescences of blood-red flowers appear in early winter and continue up to early spring with red buds as attractively colored as the flower and yellow stamens that add to the show. These flowers stretch high above the spiky green foliage.",
    "origin_history": "Aloe 'Erik the Red' is a complex hybrid involving Aloe mawii, which contributed its dark red color combined with A. petricola, A. marlothii (red form) and A. arborescens. It was named after the breeder's eldest son, whom he notes is 'also a tall fella' and was awarded the Gold Medal at the Brisbane Horticultural Show in Australia. This plant was first introduced into the US in 2012 and also included other very nice aloe cultivars such as 'Fairy Pink', 'Moonglow', 'Scarlet Rockets' and 'Topaz'.",
    "care_cultivation": "Aloe 'Erik the Red' is a tough perennial and can thrive in harsh landscaping conditions but will benefit from occasional watering, particularly during summer months. This plant prefers to be positioned in areas of full sun with well drained soils. The more sun exposure, the darker the red hue. Removing side shoots on the main stems can neaten up the plant and promote earlier flowering. It is always better to remove shoots from a tall-stemmed plant such as Erik the Red because shoots will delay the first flower. Also remember that aloes are top-heavy plants and it is advisable to have the tall stemmed ones grow as upright as possible.",
    "frost": "Aloe 'Erik the Red' is equipped with a moderate frost tolerance, as well as withstanding high levels of rain. It is noted as hardy to a medium frost so likely cold tolerant to temperatures down to the mid to high 20's F.",
    "use": "Created as a striking feature plant, Aloe 'Erik the Red' is perfect for small gardens because of its narrow form. With tall, blood red inflorescences towering over nearby plants of similar size, this tall stemmed beauty is indeed a focal point in any aloe planting. A beautiful statement plant that will add a tropical desert feel to any garden or landscape.

    "description": "The plant in itself is very tough, and can often survive for several seasons without water, at which point the leaves turn reddish, a sign generally associated with stress. The plant is compact, stemless, and almost never offsets (in cultivation), but in habitat it occurs in clusters of up to 10 or more decumbent stems up to 50 cm tall, covered with old leaves bases. This plant is characterized by its stiff, unbending, upright, turquoise to sea-green leaves heavily armed with white spines, sometimes tipped with black on not only the leaf margins but along the center of the back of each leaf. The leaves are narrowly triangular, up to 10 inches (25 cm) long and up to 1.6 inches (4 cm) wide at the base. Very attractive species, but also very hardwired for winter rainfall. In cultivation the plant seems to remain exactly the same size for years.",
    "flowering": "During the winter Aloe erinacea produces flowers on solitary, usually unbranched stalks and only about a foot high or less. The flowers are tubular in shape, bright red in bud, but turn yellow after opening. Aloe erinacea produces nectar, and is therefore pollinated by birds as well as winged and crawling insects such as ants which are small enough to enter the flower tube in which the nectar is stored. It is also very slow to flower, and it's even rare in its native land for it to flower.",
    "origin_history": "Aloe erinacea is found growing in very arid areas in rocky and sandy soils on the northern hills and mountains of southwestern Namibia at 900 - 1350 m. in altitude. Only recently (botanically) discovered in the mid 1980's in Namibia, it seems strange that such an impressive plant could have remained unknown for so long. Aloe erinacea is considered endangered in habitat but reasonably common in cultivation where seeds can be produced by hand pollination.",
    "care_cultivation": "Aloe erinacea is one of the slowest growing specie and quite difficult to care for out of habitat. This plant does well in direct sun but needs excellent drainage and does not like intense summer heat. Light fertilizer seems to boost its growth whenever additional water is given. Aloe erinaceas growing outdoors in California, unless in a great microclimate, seem predisposed to decline eventually (rotting slowly from the bottom up).",
    "frost": "It's fairly cold tolerant, for an aloe.",
    "use": "It does well planted in the ground, but it is rarely grown outdoors since large plants are costly. This plant is really best for pot culture due to its smaller size and 'waste' as a landscape plant. Makes a wonderful, drought tolerant ornamental for warm temperate climates in USDA Zones 9 and above.",

    "overview": "Aloe excelsa is a single stemmed tree-like aloe, occurring on granite outcrops, or on steep rocky slopes, which can grow to 10-20 feet (2 - 6 m) tall. Also known as the Zimbabwe Aloe it has a solitary large rosette of succulent dull green leaves with red-brown sharp teeth on leaf margins and undersides.",
    "description": "The Zimbabwe Aloe is a tall aloe, sometimes reaching tree dimensions of 5–6 metres, although 3 metres is a more common height. Stem are single, up to 6m high, woody, normally covered in dried leaves except for the lowermost part. The leaves form a compact rosette of dull blue-green leaves, at the top, spreading becoming recurved and up to 1 metre long. Similar to some other aloe species, young plants have a great number of spines over their leaf surfaces. However, as they taller and less vulnerable to grazing, these brown-red teeth disappear and remain only on the leaf margins.",
    "flowering": "Aloe excelsa puts up a showy candelabra like inflorescence which grows to 4 1/2 feet tall and branched into 10 to 15 racemes in late winter through early spring. Flowers are deep crimson red to orange-red in color, and tubular in shape.",
    "origin_history": "In its natural habitat, in southern and central Africa (Zimbabwe, South Africa, Mozambique, Malawi and Zambia, it grows at up to 1 mile in altitude. The Aloe's name 'excelsa' means 'lofty' or 'high' and it refers to the height of the plant. The Zimbabwe aloe is also named for the large number of specimens found growing around the ruins of Great Zimbabwe (which was the capital of the Kingdom of Zimbabwe during the country's Late Iron Age), where it has attracted much attention for its size and shape. Aloe excelsa has been granted tree status in South Africa and its national tree number is 28.8.",
    "care_cultivation": "Aloe excelsa thrives best with ample water during its warm season, benefits from good drainage, and prefers a dry period in winter, when its impressive flowers appear. Within this plants native range, it favors localities with good drainage and moderately stable soils, such as rocky, wooded hillsides.",
    "frost": "It tolerates light frost during its resting (and flowering) season which occurs occasionally at its favored altitudes of 800–1600 metres.",
    "use": "Aloe excelsa makes an attractive addition as a specimen plant to warmer gardens that only occasionally receive a light frost. This Aloe from Mozambique has attracted the attention of gardeners and parks planners for its imposing appearance although is still rare in gardens.",

    "description": "Aloe ferox grows up to 6-9 feet tall (180-270 cm) and 3-5 feet wide (90-160 cm). It is a variable species, and plants may differ physically from area to area, due to local conditions. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, arranged in rosettes, and have reddish-brown spines on the margins with smaller spines on the upper and lower surfaces on younger plants. The old leaves remain after they have dried, forming a petticoat on the stem. The leaves are a dull green, sometimes with a slightly blue look to them. They may also have a reddish tinge.",
    "flowering": "Aloe ferox displays flowers atop a large candelabra-like inflorescence. There are usually between five and eight branches, each carrying a spike-like head of many flowers. In late fall to mid-winter Cape Aloe produces bright red-orange, tubular flowers with inner white petals and dark orange stamens protruding from the mouth. The flowers produce nectar and are attractive to birds and bees.",

In parts of South Africa, the bitter yellow juice found just below the skin has been harvested as a renewable resource for two hundred years. The hard, black, resinous product is known as Cape aloes or aloe lump and is used mainly for its laxative properties but is also taken for arthritis. 'Schwedenbitters' which is found in many pharmacies contains bitter aloe. The gel-like flesh from the inside of the leaves is used in cosmetic products and is reported to have wound-healing properties. It also is used in scalp to promote hair growth and prevent dandruff. In South Africa, the gel is used to make a jam and as an ingredient in food and drinks. Dry leaves are used in making herbal tea and the flowers are sucked for their sweet nectar. The leaf ash is used as an insect repellent.",

    "description": "This hybrid, which involves Aloe vaombe, A. barberae, and A. dichotoma, is a rather massive tree eventually, as the name suggests. Aloe 'Goliath' averages 8 to 12 feet in height with a spread of 4 to 5 feet. Problem with the Aloe 'Goliath' hybrid is it insists on growing a larger and larger head of massively thick, heavy, drooping, long, rubbery green leaves on a ridiculously skinny trunk inherited from Aloe vaombe. The main contribution of the Aloe barberae seems to be in the thick, heaviness and rubberiness of the leaves weighs at least a few pounds, possibly 5-10. Leaves have almost no teeth along their margins. The Goliath Aloe has a vase-like upright form, slightly arching leaves with parallel veins and a fast growth rate. It will produce pups or offsets.",
    "flowering": "Mature Aloe 'Goliath' plants produce an inflorescence in late fall or winter that branches near the crown of leaves with many upright branches that rise 2 to 3 feet bearing salmon to orange flowers. Flowers are very similar to Aloe vaombe flowers but not quite as spectacular.",
    "origin_history": "Aloe 'Goliath' is believed to have originated as a garden cross of the large South African tree aloe, Aloe barberae (A. bainesii), and Aloe vaombe from Madagascar. The plants were selected as seedlings by Don Newcomer of Serra Gardens, who had these two plants situated together in his garden in Malibu Canyon. The plant looked large and stout so the name Goliath seemed a natural name.",
    "care_cultivation": "Plant in full sun in a well-drained soil. Once established, it has good drought tolerance, but will look better with water in dry spells and needs very little, if any, water in winter. This plant shows hybrid vigor which may exceed its own ability to support itself. The stems of some older specimens have been known to break or fall over from their own weight so the best advice for this plant is to try to grow it slowly by not applying too much water or fertilizer lest the large foliage heads become too heavy. This plant is a fast grower, even more so if given ample water and fertilizer in the warm months.",

The racemes are cylindrical, resembling the inflorescences of the Australian protea relatives in the genus Banksia. The red flower buds fade to pale yellow before opening with flaring petals.",
    "origin_history": "This plant is endemic to the Fort Dauphin region in the extreme south-west of the Toliara Province of Madagascar, where only two or three very small populations are known to occur in thorny bush along sandy shores. The plant's name honors Helen Decary, the wife of Raymond Decary, a French financial administrator and 20th century botanist in Madagascar. It is estimated that there are around 200 – 500 Vahondrandras in the wild and that its population may be dwindling. Aloe helenae is considered critically endangered. The biggest threat to the survival of Vahondrandra is the destruction of its habitat, which is being cleared for agriculture and mining. While the Vahondranda may not survive in the wild for much longer, there are a few living plants in botanic gardens around the world. Also, Vahondradra is occasionally being sold for private cultivation, but is still quite rare both in its natural habitat and in other parts of the world.",

    "overview": "Native to Namibia, Aloe hereroensis is an attractive 'medium-small' glaucous, pale blue-green aloe, usually solitary or with only a few rosettes in a clump that has 'fat', upward curving leaves with white linear flecking.",
    "description": "The Aloe hereroensisis is largely solitary and almost stemless but as ages, it may develop a short erect stem and grows to 1 to 2 feet tall. The plants tend to grow single rosettes with up to 30 leaves, but may be branched to comprise up to three similar rosettes. It has smooth pale blue-green leaves that curve upward, are flecked with white lines on the upper surface and capital h-shaped spots on the lower, especially in juvenile plants. Their margins are lined with small, sharp, red-brown spines.",
    "flowering": "Aloe hereroensis blooms in mid-winter to early spring. Flowers are multicolored orange to red and appear in flattened branched racemes that are wider than long. Flowering seems to depend a lot of sunny position, with shaded plants rarely flowering. Shades of orange and red are the most common flower coloring, but there is a pure yellow variety found in the central pro Namib regions. Up to three branched inflorescences can arise from a single rosette. The inflorescence is usually repeatedly branched, resulting in an elaborate panicle presenting a colorful display.",
    "origin_history": "Aloe hereroensis is a Namibian aloe primarily, but present in several southern African countries from Angola to South Africa, often found in rocky and sandy soils in dry areas. The name 'hereroensis' refers to the presence of this plant in the regions inhabited by the Hereros people a tribe in the Bantu group, who live in Namibia, Botswana and Angola. In their language the common name for the plant is 'Sandaalwyn' which translates to 'Sand Aloe'. A. hereroensis usually grows in very alkaline soils or sometimes on quartzite in high summer rainfall areas.",
    "care_cultivation": "Habitats of the Sand Aloe range from sandy plains, to mountain cliffs and rock strewn hills and slopes to to freezing conditions found in southern Namibia. Plant in full sun in a well-drained alkaline soil. Aloe hereroensis prefers a flat sandy or stony habitat but it may also be found on rocky slopes. Irrigate carefully so not to overwater. Aloe hereroensis forms hybrids with other species.",
    "frost": "Aloe hereroensis is reported as moderately hardy showing no damage to temps in the mid 20s in southern California.",
    "use": "The Sand Aloe makes a dramatic specimen plant in rock gardens, succulent gardens, Mediterranean gardens or decorative containers. Excellent landscape aloe as has a ghostly appearance in full sun.",

    "description": "Aloe hildebrandtii is a branching shrubby plant with many 2-4 feet long stems composed of individual rosettes, each about one foot in diameter. This aloe has a looser growth habit than many upright aloes. This Aloe is similar to Aloe arborescens in form but not as upright in habit. The leaves are light green and speckled with white spots, and the margins are lined with small, triangular shaped, brownish teeth. Very drought tolerant.",
    "flowering": "Aloe hildebrandtii makes interesting branched conical yellow flowers tipped with a bit of green in the spring, summer and into fall. Mature plants have been seen in flower nearly every month of the year in California. The multicolored inflorescence is short and sparse.",
    "origin_history": "Aloe hildebrandtii is from Somalia and Ethiopia. The precise origin of this Somalian species was shrouded in mystery for nearly a century. Aloe authority G. W. Reynolds surmised that it was found in the mountains of northern Somalia based on Dr. Hildebrandt’s general account of his African Travels of 1873 and 1874. Subsequently, it was found to be fairly widely distributed in those mountains where it varies in flower color from yellow to pastel orange or even dull scarlet.",
    "care_cultivation": "Easy to grow plant and seedlings grow to flowering plants in just a 3 to 4 years.",
    "frost": "Reported as having withstood a number of California frosts to the mid-20s. Aloe hildebrandtii seems fairly cold hardy down to around 26F - lower temperatures result in severe damage or death.",

    "description": "Aloe humilis is a variable specie and this variation is due to the various growing conditions of its distribution area but remains small. The hedgehog aloe is stemless with rosettes up to 20 cm in diameter which form dense groups of 10 or more. There are 20-30 short, waxy leaves per rosette. Leaves are triangular, thick pale blue-green, with irregular bumps and soft spines that take the form of small white prickles and nodules on both sides of the leaf.",
    "flowering": "The hedgehog aloe has very large blooms compared to the size of the plant. In late winter into spring Aloe humilis produces a simple inflorescence (unbranched) roughly 1 foot tall. The raceme is oblong with 20 or so bell shaped (pendulous), bright orange-scarlet colored flowers.",
    "origin_history": "The specie name 'humilis' means 'low growing' and refers to the plants growth habit. Aloe humilis comes from arid areas from Mosselbay in the east through the Little Karoo to Grahamstown in the west and north to Somerset East and Graaf-Reinett. It has gone under many different names including Aloe subtuberculata, Aloe suberecta, Aloe tuberculata, Aloe incurva, Aloe acuminata, Catevala humilis, Aloe perfoliata var. humilis and Aloe echinata and is similar to (when not in flower) and confused with the slightly larger and harder to grow Aloe longistyla.",
    "care_cultivation": "Aloe humilis is an easy to grow, adaptable little aloe, requiring very little care. It will tolerate light shade but the plant looks its best when grown in full sun. Although it can withstand long periods of drought, these aloes will thrive and flower more profusely if watered occasionally. This Aloe is drought tolerant with little to no irrigation required and is best when sheltered from getting overly wet in winter. Propagate by division of larges clumps, putting the 'pups' in a tray of coarse river sand until they have rooted. Pick containers with drainage holes and use well-draining cactus and succulent soil with 50% to 70% mineral grit such as coarse sand, pumice, or perlite. Over-watering, poor drainage or too much shade can lead to attack by pests and diseases. Aloe humilis forms many offsets which can easily be removed placed in pots and rockeries.",
    "frost": "Hardy to the low 20's F. It is interesting to note that plants that come from the Graaff-Reinet area are frost hardy, whereas those that grow closer to the coast are unable to tolerate any frost at all.",
    "use": "In mild climates it can be cultivated outdoors for use in landscaping. This is a useful little aloe for rocky, exposed areas of the garden and grows happily in small pockets of a rockery where you want some non-green color. Aloe humilis can be used as a container plant on a patio, but important to note that the soil must be well draining.",

    "description": "Aloe kedongensis branches from the base to form thick clumps of stems, each up to 4 meters long, and either erect or sprawling on the ground. Foliage color and density gives plant a more lush presence than many aloes. The stems lie over and the plant can spread laterally to form large clumps. Each stem is topped by a rosette of leaves. The slender leaves in mature plants are recurved and without any markings. Sometimes confused with Aloe arborescens in cultivation, but slightly less robust and shorter shrubs, with smaller leaves and more narrowly, upright-oriented rosettes. In the wild, the plant develops an extremely large trunk and root system.",
    "flowering": "Aloe kedongensis salmon-orange flowers that appear on mostly simple (unbranched) spikes in late winter and spring. The inflorescence is 50 cm (20 inch) tall. This aloe's racemes are conical to globoid in shape. The tips of the tubular flower lobes curve outwards.",
    "origin_history": "From the Kedong Valley, part of the Great Rift Valley system of Kenya, Aloe kedongensis is one of a group of closely related tetraploid aloes that all grow near each other in East Africa and share a recent common ancestor. The other aloes in this group are Aloe cheranganiensis, Aloe dawei, Aloe elgonica, and Aloe nyeriensis. The plant name refers to this plant being from the Kedong Valley, which was the site of an tragic massacre in 1895 involving tribal Swahili and Maasai with misinterpreted intervention by the British Army. This plant was first described by Gilbert Westacott Reynolds (1895-1967) in the Journal of South African Botany (v19 n4) in 1953. The plant is harvested from the wild for local use as a medicine, source of dyes and as an aid to fermentation.",

The long and relatively narrow, pale green leaves curve upwards from the base and outward at their tips giving this Aloe a graceful appearance.",
    "description": "Aloe khamiesensis are erect plants that usually from a rosette on a single stem that can be up to 3 meters tall, occasionally branches into two heads. The plant is very tough and can survive often for several seasons without water, at which point the leaves turn a reddish color, a sign generally associated with stress. The leaves are lancheolate and a dark dull green with white spots with reddish-brownish teeth on the margins, making this species quite distinctive. Aloe khamiesensis is attractive species from rocky areas of the northern Cape with a thick usually unbranched trunk.",
    "flowering": "The flowers of Aloe khamiesensis appear in mid-winter and are held near the top of a branched conical raceme that terminates in erect clusters of orange-red yellow-tipped flowers. In some specimens the flower tips are tinged a greenish-yellow color. The inflorescences are repeatedly branched to form between four and eight racemes. Racemes are triangular in shape with tubular shaped flowers. Aloe khamiesensis produces nectar and is pollinated by birds as well as winged and crawling insects such as ants which are small enough to enter the flower tube in which the nectar is stored. As with other aloes, the seeds are typically winged, 8 mm x 4 mm, and are produced in abundance inside the fruit capsules that split into three when ripe.",
    "origin_history": "This aloe has a fairly restricted distribution in the mountainous areas of Namaqualand and from near Calvinia in the Northern Cape of South Africa on mostly granite and sandstone derived soils. The plant's name refers to the Khamiesberg and Khamieskroon locations where this aloe was originally collected. Other common names for this plant include Tweederly, Aloeboom (meaning Aloe Tree) and Wilde-aalwyn (meaning Wild Aloe). It’s considered a threatened species.The number of individuals has started to decrease because of uncontrolled collection.",
    "care_cultivation": "Aloe Khamiesensis requires a well-drained soil, composed of one third of sand or pebbles, to prevent roots rotting. Also leaf rotting can occur, if you wet too much the leaves while watering and you water too much frequently. Watering can be almost completely suspended in winter (once a month it’s sufficient) and, in spring and summer, watering once or twice every two weeks is sufficient. Before each watering, it’s better to wait until the soil is completely dry. Aloe Khamiesensis needs bright light, especially in winter. OK outdoors in mild areas.",
    "frost": "There is not a good frost hardiness data on this plant but older specimens can be found in southern California and it is likely this plant can handle at least infrequent temperatures down to 25 F. It can survive temperatures close to 0C but, to prevent damages, it’s better to keep it indoors, especially if you live in a region with cold winters.",

Plants may be found growing as generally solitary, grey-green rosettes without any spots or spines on both upper and lower surfaces. In older specimens stems may be visible but in most cases the plants appear stemless with dense leaf arrangements. The thick leaves are arranged in a spiraled rosette in old plants, but in very young plants they are ranked in vertical rows. Leaves are incurving, short (about 3-5 inches long), stiff but slightly bendable with very tiny, closely spaced teeth along the margins. Aloe krapohliana leaf color will turn to dark green for plants not kept in a lot of sunlight.",
    "flowering": "The inflorescence of Aloe krapohliana are thick & large, mostly unbranched though occasionally double-branched. Up to 6 inflorescences may appear from one single rosette, making them one of the most prolific bloomers of all aloes. It is quite remarkable how large the inflorescence can be, compared to the size of the plant. In habitat this is particularly noticeable when the small plant advertises itself by its bright flowers that tower over the small bushes in which it shelters. The flowers are orange-red & bloom in winter. Flowers are tubular in shape, 35mm in length, dull orange with tips tinged a greenish-yellow color.",
    "origin_history": "Aloe krapohliana is found on sandy flats and rocky slopes in the arid, northwestern corner of the Northern Cape otherwise known as the Succulent Karoo. The name krapohliana was given in honour of Mr H.C. Krapohl who first collected the plants near Pella in the early 1800s. Summers are hot and arid and the rainfall in winter is very low, they are usually found under bushes plant in shade. Aloe krapohliana is vulnerable due to overgrazing, collecting and mining activities.",

Aloe krapohliana is found in an extremely arid part of the Northern Cape and it will not tolerate overwatering. This species, as others in its group, will simply not thrive away from its natural arid habitat. Native to the winter rainfall areas of South Africa, so don’t water on a hot day! It’s the easiest way to kill this aloe. Grow this plant in full sun to part shade.",

    "care_cultivation": "This plant's native habitat in the Little Karoo is an area that gets some summer rainfall and plants seem tolerant of both drier conditions and regular summer irrigation. Aloe lineata is best grown in an area with a soil that is freely draining, this helps prevent diseases such as rot. Plant in full sun.",
    "frost": "Aloe lineata var. muirii thrives in areas with minimal frost. This plant's hardiness has not been well documented although it has survived undamaged to 25F. The species Aloe lineata (var. lineata) has proven hardy to around 20F and the variety muirii is likely as hardy.",
    "use": "Aloe lineata var. muiri is an attractive and rewarding garden plant. Its striking yellowish green leaves and tall flower spikes will give much needed contrast to any garden theme. A. lineata var. muiri is drought tolerant and an ideal plant to use in any landscape that strives to be water-wise.",

    "description": "Aloe lavranosii is usually a solitary and stemless plant with somewhat bendable, spreading, tapering leaves with relatively prominent teeth. The plant is medium size, with leaves that may turn bright pink or other funky colors with drought stress. Leaf color is often a dull grey olive green to brownish green, unless grown in shade then it is a deep blue-green which looks good but not healthy for this species. Leaves are flattish, wide at the base and have sharp teeth. Very drought tolerant plant. It is one of the few species of Aloe with 'hairy' flowers. Aloe lavranosii sometimes produce offsets.",
    "flowering": "The generally fuzzy flowers occur in mid-summer on tall, multi-branched inflorescences. Colors are usually pale yellow, but can be a variety of shades of orange to scarlet. The flowers may be variable, in terms of color as well as pubescence. Its hair is quite long, but varies in density and may be white or brownish. Aloe lavranosii has a relatively sparse amount of hairs compared to the other species of Aloe with fuzzy flowers on the Arabian Peninsula.",

    "aka": [],
    "overview": "Aloe longistyla is a small South African, dwarf, aloe that suckers with time to form a group of 6 to 8 inch wide rosettes with upright blue-green leaves. A distinct trait of this aloe are the thick, pale, soft, spines on its lower leaf surfaces and margins.",
    "description": "Aloe longistyla is a very tough little plant which can withstand several years of drought and looks roughly like a thick-leaved Aloe humilis. This plant is a dwarf, stemless aloe to about 5 inches tall, usually solitary, but may well have 2 or 3 rosettes. Aloe longistyla usually has 20-30 leaves in a compact spiraled rosette at the stem apex in old plants, but in juvenile plants they are ranked in vertical rows. The densely crowded, lanceolate leaves have a conspicuous waxy layer on their surfaces. Colors of leaves are forest green to pale blue or bluish-green. Have lots of long, but not super sharp teeth along leaf margins and backs of leaves. The teeth base is tubercular. It is very slow to sucker if at all. Very drought tolerant, but if not given any summer water, tends to curl in on itself a bit and look ugly.",
    "flowering": "When in flower it is easily identified in In fall to winter by the short, thick, unbranched inflorescences and broad racemes that can have up to fifty flowers. This species has one of the largest inflorescences in terms of size of plant within the Aloaceae. The tubular flowers are deep orange to salmon red or coral-red and form on a conical raceme. An unmistakable characteristic of the flowers is that their top halves are curved upwards to expose the unusually long stamens. The flowers are followed by large gray fruit capsules. This aloe, when not in flower, may easily be confused with A. humilis and A. brevifolia which superficially look similar but their flowers do not posses the unusually long styles found on A. longistyla.",
    "origin_history": "Aloe longistyla is mostly in the summer rainfall regions from the Western Cape Province of South Africa, with some overlap into the Eastern Cape. Populations are found as scattered individuals, never in dense groups and often partly shaded by short, scrubby vegetation predominantly of Pentzia, Pteronia and Nestlera species. The plant name 'longistyla' refers to the 'long style' of the exceptionally long stamens which protrude from the mouth of the flower. Aloe longistyla is stated as vulnerable.",
    "care_cultivation": "Plant in full sun to light shade in well-drained soil. Very drought tolerant but looks best with occasional irrigation in summer. It is a challenge to successfully grow Aloe longistyla, and is therefore sought after by the enthusiast. Plants should therefore not be removed from the natural environment as they do not respond positively to transplantation at all. Success may be achieved by sowing fresh seeds but even this is not guaranteed to produce size-able plants. It can be grown in large containers. Can withstand long periods of drought, but they will thrive and flower more profusely if watered in the correct season. Incorrect watering, poor drainage or too much shade can lead to attack by pests and diseases.",
    "frost": "Cold Hardy to around the low 20's F.",
    "use": "It is a very rewarding plant, especially in winter when the flowers add a fiery glow to an otherwise drab garden. In mild climates it can be cultivated outdoors for use in landscaping, preferably planting it in hot and dry rock gardens. Well suited to a rock garden, on a sloping bank or even in containers.

    "overview": "Aloe maculata is a stemless aloe, that reaches 18 inches (45 cm) tall and 2 feet (60 cm) wide that can sucker freely or grow solitarily. Native to South Africa, this is a very hardy aloe, making a large group of suckers and its quite thorny too. The Soap Aloe is a delightful spotted succulent with distinctive flat-topped inflorescence in hues of orange, red and yellow that provides striking texture year round.",
    "description": "The 'Soap Aloe' is usually stemless, clumping, often overgrown in succulent gardens. Foliage color depends on light intensity - pinkish red in hot sun and bluish-green in part shade. The leaves are broadly triangular and vary considerably in length and shape, but are mostly recurved towards the dried, twisted tips. Aloe maculata is a common species with linear spots that are distinctively 'H-shaped'. The foliage is dark green at the tips with a reddish tinge; the lower part of the leaf fades to a light green and is marked by faint white spots. The margins are lined with prominent and sharp, brown teeth able to draw the blood of an unwary gardener. This is one of the more aggressive and 'invasive' aloe species, sometimes showing up many feet away from the parent plant. Mature plants can form large groups, spreading via stolons (Stoloniferous plants send out stems that grow at the soil surface or just below ground.)",
    "flowering": "Aloe maculata is very variable but its distinctly flat-topped inflorescences and usually uniformly colored flowers distinguish it from most other spotted aloes occurring in the same area. Flowers are held in on a multi-branched inflorescence over a long period in summer. Flowers of A maculata 'saponaria' usually yellow, but color ranges widely from yellow and red to salmon-orange. Flowering can occur any time of year, but usually in mid-winter in southern California. This is a very pretty aloe when in flower, especially if one is not that attracted to the spiky form of most aloe flowers. Seeds are reputedly poisonous.",
    "origin_history": "This plant has long been in cultivation under the name Aloe saponaria but the correct name is now Aloe maculata. The specific name of saponaria is from the use of this plant for soap in its native South Africa. It has been suggested by some botanists that the better-known and long-used name, Aloe saponaria, be conserved as it is the name for the type plant for the section Saponariae. They occur in a variety of habitats, ranging from rocky outcrops to thicket and grasslands. Aloe maculata has a wide distribution from the Cape Peninsula through the Western and Eastern Cape Province. Plants usually prefer the milder coastal climates but are also found as a component of the higher altitude Drakensberg flora.",
    "care_cultivation": "This plant is drought tolerant and ideally suited for full sun although is quite shade tolerant as well. Aloe maculata is a relatively fast grower and very easy to cultivate. Grows in thick, poorly draining soils as well as better quality soil. It is a very variable species and hybridizes easily with other similar aloes, sometimes making it difficult to identify. Aloe maculata adapts to an extensive range of conditions – soil, seasonal and quantities of rain, temperature.",
    "frost": "Hardy to about 20-25 degrees F.",
    "use": "Though it can be a bit invasive it is not hard to control and is good for growing under trees or in exposed spots with poor soil where other plants have trouble. Also often added to pots with a variety of other succulents and sold at garden outlet centers. Although essentially a summer garden plant, it is indeed a garden plant for all seasons. There is always something of interest, even in mid winter when the vivid red and yellow to orange flowers stand out against the background of faded dry grass.",

It is single-stemmed, and can grow up to a tree-like 15 feet tall. This striking species of aloe has an especially large robust head of stiff, grey-green leaves. The mountain aloe is without doubt one of southern Africa's most rewarding aloes to grow and adds an interesting slant to aloe culture.",
    "description": "This is the archetypical aloe, towering majestically, with densely prickled, large, boat-shaped leaves on a strong stem. Usually single stemmed & eventually tree like (to 15’ tall), this species starts out as a huge rosette of thick gray-green leaves well armed with brown teeth. The plant usually has a solitary, unbranched stem, though sometimes it suckers to form small groups of plants. It normally has a trunk densely covered by the withered old leaves. The leaves of the Mountain Aloe are large, of a gray-green color, with reddish-brown spines along the margins and randomly on other parts of the leaf. The large leaves have a broad base tapering to a sharp point and are up to 5 feet (1.5 m) long, up to 10 inches (25 cm) wide.",
    "flowering": "In late fall to late winter the flowers of Aloe marlothii are held on racemes on a branched candelabra-shaped inflorescence, having up to 30 racemes (single spikes covered with individual flowers). The distinctively horizontal branches of large 4 foot tall & wide inflorescence is an easy way to distinguish this species from other aloes. The rosette produces a candelabra of tubular shaped flowers. Flower color varies a great deal, and ranges from yellow through orange (most common) to bright red.",

One of the most floriferous Aloes in South Africa, Aloe microstigma is a medium size, easy, relatively fast growing plant, tolerating summer watering and some shade, as well as poor soils.",
    "description": "Rosette-forming succulent that is usually solitary or sometimes found in small clumps to 2 feet tall with long tapering white-spotted blue-green leaves. Young plants are stemless, while the older ones develop a short decumbent stem up to 50 cm tall and 10 cm wide, which is usually covered with remains of old leaves. The rosette of leaves helps to cool the plant in that the upper leaves provides shading for the lower ones. Rosettes about 1 to 1.5' feet in diameter, uprightly oriented. The leaves are adorned with conspicuous white spots, which contrast nicely with the reddish teeth along the edges. An interesting adaptation is the inward folding of leaves during the hot summer months. This helps to protect the softer and younger leaves from extreme temperatures. Leaves unfold again in cool weather. In winter, leaves can become incredibly colorful showing pinks, purples, yellows and greens. Leaves not very bendable. The leaves of this aloe are protected from the intense summer sun by anthocyanin pigments that give them a dull red glow. In shade leaves have a more turquoise coloration. Leaf surfaces are smooth, leaf margins are armed with sharp, stiff reddish-brown triangular teeth.",
    "flowering": "From it's rosette Aloe microstigma produces several unbranched (simple) inflorescences up to 3 feet (90 cm) tall. This plant is a beautiful aloe which usually produces two or three profuse, flower spikes simultaneously in early winter. The bicolored flowers are red in bud and open to orange and yellow orange. In some places, however, the buds and open flowers may be uniformly red or yellow. Noted sometimes for their bicolor look, the cheerful flowers brighten the dull winter landscape with their towering warm colors reminiscent of flames on candles. Flowers are tubular in shape and slightly swollen in the middle.",
    "origin_history": "Aloe microstigma is common in the Eastern and Western Cape Provinces of South Africa, and the species extends northward through the Great Karoo into southern Namibia. The name accurately describes the distinguishing feature of the plant, microstigma means 'very small spot'. It is found in a wide variety of habitats, in flat open areas, steep rocky slopes, or amongst bushes. Where Aloe microstigma grows, it is almost invisible between rocks and dry bushes.",
    "care_cultivation": "This aloe is a common and widely distributed plant in the dry inland areas of the Western and Eastern Cape Provinces and is a great plant in cultivation in sparsely irrigated California gardens, but it can tolerate more regular irrigation if soil drains well. When grown in a sheltered area and kept out of cold winds Aloe microstigma does well in cultivation. Aloe microstigma is best grown from fresh seeds that are sown in summer or autumn. A coarse sandy medium must be used and seeds are sprinkled lightly and covered slightly with sand. If kept moist, (not wet) seeds germinate within two weeks. The most common pests on Aloe microstigma are scale, the aloe snout beetle, and aphids. These can all be successfully treated with contact or systemic pesticides. If plants are to be fed, use only organic based fertilisers in a liquid solution. These can be applied as a soil drench or sprayed on plants once a month. Plant in full sun.",
    "frost": "This plant has been noted as hardy to the low 20s by Brian Kemble at the Ruth Bancroft Garden. The winter flowers may sometimes be damaged by frost.",
    "use": "They make particularly nice low maintenance garden plants which are especially attractive when in flower in the barren winter months. Plants do exceptionally well in cultivation and prefer dry gardens. Aloe microstigma can also grow in wetter gardens, if drainage is good. They are ideal plants for a difficult or neglected part of the garden and with the addition of other suitable plants can create stunning rock gardens. Companion plants such as Cotyledon orbiculata, Tylecodon paniculatus, Crassula arborescens, Aloe dichotoma, Aloe brevifolia, Pelargonium crithmifolium, Pelargonium sericifolia, etc., are ideal to start a rock garden.

    "slug": "aloe-mitriformis",
    "aka": ["Aloe perfoliata", "Kransaalwyn", "Mitre Aloe", "Rubble Aloe"],
    "overview": "Aloe mitriformis is a true Cape mountain and winter-rainfall species that has thick, short leaves that are arranged in a rosette style with short barbs along the outer edges and beautiful flowers.",
    "description": "Aloe mitriformis is a hardy clustering succulent forming groups of rosettes in small colonies. The stems are fairly thin and not strong enough to support the large rosettes in an erect position. These typically lie along the ground with only the terminal, leaf-bearing portion being erect.The leaves, are arranged in rosettes (circular leaf attachments), may spread erectly or curve inward. The thick, fleshy leaves often curve inwards during times of drought – making the rosette look rather like a mitre (until recently this species was known as Aloe mitriformis because of this resemblance). The leaves are short, fleshy, bluish-green in color and broad in a rosette and are edged in sturdy teeth. Plants that are in full sun often have more bluish leaves than those that are in shady areas which have more dark green leaves. Also, plants that are fully exposed have a tighter leaf arrangements compared to the more spaced leaves on shaded specimens. The leaf margins are armed with harmless, small white teeth, which turn yellow to dark brown as leaves become older. The slightly incurved leaves and variably colored marginal spines appear to be consistent features of the species. During dry conditions, the leaves assume a red color. The yellow teeth along the edges contrast nicely with the deep green of the leaves. In its natural habitat, the plants have long and creeping stems that often have secondary side shoots along their length. Aloe mitriformis occurs mostly in groups and also may grow down vertical cliffs is a particularly fast-growing, tough and adaptable species that easily copes with the elements. A. mitriformis is one of seven aloes with distinctive creeping stems. The Rubble Aloe is extremely variable-looking, depending on its environment, making it difficult to identify sometimes. The stems of this succulent aloe trail along the ground, often rooting where they touch down.",
    "flowering": "There are not many aloes from the Cape that flower during summer, hence those that do are more sought after. In a single plant there can be 4-5 inflorescences bearing dense racemes of red, tubular, 3-4 centimeters long flowers. The shape of the racemes varies from cone-shaped to head-shaped or rounded. The flowers are tubular, droop, are a coral to bright red and appear in dense arrangements on the branched stalks.",
    "origin_history": "Aloe mitriformis is now known as Aloe perfoliata. Aloe mitriformis is found in abundance in almost all the mountainous parts of the Western Cape of South Africa. It prefers flat, rocky places although it is not uncommon on vertical cliff faces. Plants are found characteristically among rubble-like sandstone slabs and rock, hence the other unofficial Afrikaans common name, puin aalwyn, meaning rubble aloe. Aloe mitriformis is so named because of the resemblance of its rosette to a mitre or bishop's cap especially in times of drought. This species is the most widespread of a group of closely related 'Creeping Aloes'. It is noteworthy that five of the seven creeping aloes are threatened in one or the other way.",
    "care_cultivation": "Aloe mitriformis has a preference for well-drained, sandy soils with a slight acidic pH and low humus level. The plants favour mild to hot summers and easily survive occasional snow in the rainy season. For optimal flowering, remember to plant A. mitriformis in the full sun. Mature plants in the garden may from time to time be subjected to attack from scale insects and aphids. For scale insects, an oil-based solution can be used, even soap water has proven effective against scale and the best results are obtained by physically removing scale using a cloth. All known garden pests can be kept to a minimum by simply ensuring optimal growing conditions and a good selection of plants that attract wildlife to your garden. Coming from a sub-tropical climate of South Africa and the Mediterranean regions, Aloe mitriformis is used to a dry, sunny location and it will grow best in full sun. Aloe mitriformis grows relatively slowly to a height and spread of about 18 inches. Drought tolerant. Water sparingly, especially during winter. Blackened patches on the leaves are signs of over-watering. It can be grown successfully outdoors in temperate climates during the summer months but will need to be brought inside during cold weather. Before each watering, it’s better to wait until the soil is completely dry.",
    "frost": "It will survive as low as 5 degrees C, but if you live in a temperature climate, it is best brought in during the winter months.",
    "use": "Aloe mitriformis is ideally planted in a group of ± 20 plants. Raised rock gardens that allow good drainage are the best situations for these plants. For smaller gardens the plants can be used in deep plant boxes or they also go well in larger pots where they will spill over to make interesting shapes, though not good to have where there is foot traffic close-by as the foliage is quite spiky. Embankments and retaining walls are also perfect, as the pants will naturally tend to creep and can cover large areas especially if you have a difficult or unsightly spot in the garden. This plant is particularly fast-growing and it’s a groundcover. This spreading aloe is one of the lower growing species and is therefore often used as a ground cover plant in rock gardens. Gardeners who love using bright reds, oranges and yellows will find this particular aloe quite irresistible.",

    "overview": "Aloe mudenensis native to the sandy soils in northern South Africa and Swaziland, is one of the most attractive species of short-stemmed, spotted aloes. This plant forms a short-stemmed rosette of bluish leaves with whitish markings and an erect, branched inflorescence with orange to red flowers.",
    "description": "A stem with rosettes emerging from it Aloe mudenensis may be single-headed, or it may put out a few offsets to form a small clump. Rosettes grow to a diameter of 1 to 2 feet (45 to 60 cm), with the spotted leaves becoming purplish-tinged in sunny positions. The leaves are straight, broad, 175 – 350 × 50 – 90 mm, with a bluish green color and have several scattered spots, especially on the upper surface. If Aloe mudenensis becomes too dry, the leaves will wrinkle up and the color will fade.",
    "flowering": "Aloe mudenensis inflorescence is branched, with up to 8 racemes and up to 1 meter tall. It's conical racemes are dense, and 175 mm (6+ inches) long. Bloom times vary from winter to spring depending on location with flower color varying from yellow-orange to orange to coral-red.",
    "origin_history": "Aloe mudenensis, from the area near the town of Muden in the state of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.",
    "care_cultivation": "Position Aloe mudenensis in an area that gets full sun for at least half the day. The area must also have good drainage, such as a slope, a north-facing slope being the best. Despite Aloe mudenesis being a hardy plant, it still requires nutrients to thrive. The best way to ensure healthy plants is to prepare the soil correctly with organic compost before planting and then feed every few years. Regular irrigation, especially in dry weather, will keep them lush, however, if they are exposed to too much water, the leaves will drop or the whole plant will rot. They can also be propagated from seeds which germinate easily, if sown in well-drained soil and lightly covered with fine sand. This evergreen stemless aloe is water wise and fast growing if planted in the sun. It is easy to grow in warm temperate climates in USDA Zones 9 and above.",
    "frost": "It occurs in Northern Natal, so would need protection from frost.",
    "use": "Aloe mudenensis makes a great accent plant. It is also very suitable as a container plant and small aloes can be used very effectively as border plants at the edge of a bed. It would be ideal for small gardens.",

    "description": "The rosettes of Aloe munchii are rather upright in orientation but a bit floppy due to softness of leaves. Leaves in a dense rosette at the apices of the branches, often tinged pinkish-red, particularly along the toothed margins. Usually solitary, but sometimes branching near the base, and stems rarely have dead leaves left on them. Leaves are pale blue-green and upright, similar to a solitary Aloe acutissima. It is most often solitary but occasionally seen branching from the base with upright 20 inch long leaves that recurved slightly toward the tips. Blue green, bendable, almost rubbery leaves with relatively widely spaced, non-painful yellow teeth. It grows up to 15 feet tall and is usually solitary (rarely branching, usually near base) and was until recently a pretty rare plant in cultivation. Aloe munchii is a fast grower, growing from a seedling to flowering plant in my yard in just a few years.",
    "flowering": "In the fall to early winter Aloe munchii flowers are on thick 2 to 3 branched inflorescences that rise 1 to 2 feet above the foliage.  Racemes are nearly spherical and hold bright orange flowers (with yellowy mouths as they open). The bright orange-red flowers of Aloe munchii are 35-45 mm ( 1 to 2 inches) long. The tips of the flower buds slightly upturned and have a purplish cast. Fruits are an odd pebbly consistency like a shark skin.",
    "origin_history": "This species, allied to the more southerly Aloe arborescens, comes from both sides of the Chimanimani Mountains which defines the border between Zimbabwe and Mozambique where it grows in and around quartzite rocky outcrops at an altitude between 5,000 and 7,000 feet. Aloe munchii was named after Raymond Charles Munch (1901 - 1985), Zimbabwean farmer and plant collector with a particular interest in aloes and cycads. Munch and his wife Hazel O. Munch (honored in the naming of Aloe hazeliana) explored and botanized southern and central Africa.",
    "care_cultivation": "Plant in full sun win a well drained soil. Not a great plant for an open, super windy location, as Aloe munchii gets rather top heavy and it's stems can snap. Best to plant near structures. In cultivation it can be grown in some tropical and many warm temperate climates in USDA Zones 9 and above.",

    "overview": "A beautiful, medium size, shrubby aloe with bi-color blooms and a trailing stem up to 1 meter long with offshoots. This aloe typically grows 3 to 4 feet tall and topped by 18 to 24 inch wide rosettes of narrow soft-toothed blue-green leaves. A hanging or cliff-dwelling aloe; the plants often grow precariously suspended over steep kloofs in strikingly inaccessible spots.",
    "description": "The branched stems of Aloe mutabilis may reach about 1 meter in length,  mostly curved or trailing to support the rosettes among the uneven rock or cliff edge situations of their normal habitat. The succulent rosette is about 2 feet high and wide of slightly arching, softly toothed evergreen leaves. Over time a trunk forms, sometimes upright, but more often creeping along the ground. Its stem hangs downward with the rosettes of leaves turned up at an angle. Leaves are thin, pale green to bluish green with prominent teeth and somewhat bendable, in very open, almost spiral rosettes. Aloe mutabilis is similar and closely related to the more common Aloe arborescens. Both bloom in winter but Aloe mutabilis is a smaller plant with less dense branching and bluer leaves. This aloe has many leaves, 60-70cm (2+ feet) long. The upper surfaces are glaucous green to dull green with brownish to yellow margins. The leaf margins are armed with harmless, yellowish orange teeth. The shape of the spaces between the teeth is straight, not rounded as with the commonly known Aloe arborescens.",
    "flowering": "During Winter a simple branched inflorescence up to 90cm (roughly 3 feet) high, is borne with bi-colored flowers. The flowers of Aloe mutabilis change color as they mature, with the red-orange buds opening to display yellow flowers. The flowers of some forms of Aloe mutabilis are uniformly red. Aloe mutabilis flowers are also on short pedicils with flared petals.",
    "origin_history": "Aloe mutabilis grows naturally on vertical rock faces of Witwatersrand National Botanical Garden at the Witpoortjie waterfall near Johannesburg, South Africa. First described in 1933 by South African botanist Neville Stuart Pillans, for whom Aloe pillansii was named, though some maintain that Aloe mutabilis is close enough to Aloe arborescens that it should be classed as a subspecies or a Highveld form, rather than a species in its own right. The plant's name is the Latin word for 'changeable' and it is thought that this is a reference to the changing color of the flowers as they mature but may also describe the variability of the plant. Aloe mutabilis is today considered as a specific form of Aloe arborescens.",
    "care_cultivation": "Plant in full sun to light shade. Provide excellent drainage for best health. It’s extremely drought tolerant needing no additional water along the coast. Can withstand long periods of drought, but will grow and flower better when soils is slightly moist during the growing season. Pests and diseases: White scale, aloe rust and cancer, snout beetle; more attacked when growing in un-favourable conditions (poor drainage and sunlight)",
    "frost": "This drought tolerant plant does great in coastal California without any supplementary irrigation and is cold hardy to about 21° F.",
    "use": "This plant is attractive to hummingbirds and bees and deer resistant. Makes a showy addition to a low-water garden. Its bicolored racemes make it a popular garden plant. It makes a magnificent rockery specimen when grown at the highest point of the rockery with the rosette hanging downward. Use in containers and as bold clumps in the landscape.",

This hybrid is a low-growing, rosetting aloe is a hybrid with triangular dark green leaves edged with small hooked teeth. When growing in full sun the leaves may turn a beautiful orange.",
    "description": "Forms a large rosette, up to 18 inches tall. The 'Gold Tooth Aloe' has large green leaves with white gold teeth along the margins. Depending on growing conditions sometimes the teeth are a creamy-white or yellow. The thorns on the edge of this succulent may look mean, but they won't harm you. The teeth glow when backlight by sunlight. The leaves have a narrow lanceolate, somewhat oval shape tapering at the apex to a point. 'Gold-Tooth Aloe' has green leaves that can turn orange when stressed or in full sun. Plants can develop a bit of rose color on tips. One of the most notable features of the 'Golden Toothed Aloe' is how profusely it produces offsets that can form a large colony. A variegated form has lanceolate emerald green leaves that are banded with golden yellow, and lined with gold marginal teeth. Curiously, sometimes entire offsets are pure yellow without any green.",
    "flowering": "The bright orange branched inflorescences of Aloe nobilis rise above the foliage to about 2 feet tall in mid-summer. The tubular flowers are frequently visited by hummingbirds.",
    "origin_history": "This plant is thought by some to be a hybrid between Aloe mitriformis and A. brevifolia but others suggest it may be the result of a cross between Aloe distans and A. brevifolia. 'The Illustrated Handbook of Succulent Plants: Monocotyledons' edited by Urs Eggli lists the name as being of unresolved application that should be rejected but this plant has long been in cultivation in the US and is quite common so it definitely needs a name. In 'Hortus Third' it is listed with the common names 'Golden Tooth Aloe' and 'Green and Gold Crown and described as being similar to A. mitriformis but leaves less concave above. This listing further notes it is perhaps of hybrid origins and suggests it is a cross between Aloe arborescens and A. mitriformis. Whatever its parentage, it is a stunning and tough plant that provides summer color.",
    "care_cultivation": "Aloe nobilis prefers bright, filtered light for best color. Porous soil with adequate drainage and protection from frost is needed to keep this beauty happy. Prefers ample airflow. Water thoroughly when soil is dry to the touch.",
    "frost": "Hardy to about 20 degrees F.",
    "use": "The 'Gold Tooth Aloe' can be used outside in every type of landscaping but works well as a ground-cover as it spreads relatively quickly. The clumping character provides a pleasing texture and rosette pattern in garden plantings. Combine it with winter blooming aloes for a longer show of flowers. Excellent in rock, cactus and succulent gardens. It is deer resistant and attractive to hummingbirds, bees and butterflies. This is a great container plant particularly since it needs limited root space. This plant is ideal for making a succulent terrarium or a dish garden. This hybrid aloe has intense flower color and is well suited as a feature plant in small spaces.",

    "overview": "Aloe peglerae is an unusual, small, stemless South African aloe. Stunningly attractive turquoise colored aloe easily identified by the lack of spines on the inside surfaces of each leaf. This aloe grows as a solitary rosette with the leaves curving inwards, resulting in a neat, rounded head or rarely form small groups. Aloe peglerae has unbranched inflorescence with densely set, dull red flowers that usually turn greenish yellow when opening.",
    "description": "From South Africa Aloe peglerae is stemless and clump-forming with rosettes of spreading leaves. It is one of the most easily recognizable of the aloes even when not in flower, because of its habit of growth. The rosette reach only 30-40 centimeters of diameter and the entire plant, excluding the inflorescence, reach the height of 30-40 centimeters. This aloe grows as a solitary rosette which stays stemless & remains tightly clasped in dry situations making it look a bit like an anemone curling into a ball when protecting itself. The glaucous leaves of Aloe peglerae are arranged in a rosette, curved inward so that the plant assumes a rounded, spherical aspect. With beautiful blue-grey, unspotted leaves have significant spines on the margins and undersides of the leaves. As the temperatures drop, the colors of the leaves tend to pinken as is the case in many aloes and other succulents. Leaves are slightly bendable and covered with a blush one can rub off to reveal a greener color beneath. The leaf margins of new growth have whitish spines as opposed to the reddish brown spines on older leaves. The backs of the leaves have spines midway from the base to the top. Not the fastest growing aloe of course but a wonderful fully-formed treasure even while small. It closely resembles Aloe humilis but the leaves are thicker and more rigid. It is a low growing species with irregular flowering and seed set. This unique succulent plant is classed as an endangered species.",
    "flowering": "In the winter, Aloe peglerae develops an almost comically fat, and often times single, flower stalk in the late fall with a bright red flowers. The flower buds are dull red with purplish stamens protruding from the flower tube which give the flowers a characteristic appearance. The visible portions of filaments are deep purple in color. Flowers are shy to flower unless in full sun and conditions are perfect. The flowers are pollinated by birds, bees and wind.",
    "origin_history": "Aloe peglerae is native from South Africa, it’s an endemic species to to the Magaliesberg, from near Pretoria to near Rustenburg in the Western Transvaal, and the northern, rocky slopes of the Witwatersberg. The species is named after Alice Marguerite Pegler (1861-1929), a botanist and naturalist who collected at first around Kentani, and later in the vicinity of Johannesburg and Rustenburg. It is listed in the Red Data list of South Africa as an endangered species on the extinction queue if not protected or grown for ex-situ conservation. The greatest threat to this plant is caused by over collection in the wild by plant collectors and developments along the ridges where the plants occur. It is illegal to collect this plant from the wild.",
    "care_cultivation": "Considered easy to cultivate if given well-drained soil and a sheltered spot in the garden. With regular water it opens up more. Dry conditions will give the leaves a purple color and keep the ball shape tight. Provide excellent drainage of course, but if you have a languishing plant, try regular irrigation. Before each watering, it’s better to wait until the soil is completely dry. It requires a well-drained acid soil, composed of one third of sand or pebbles, to prevent roots rotting. This species needs to be exposed to filtered light, unlike most Aloes. Of course they tolerate also a full exposure to sunlight, and the leaves, if so, will turn reddish. This aloe can be propagated from seed. Sow seed at 70 degrees Fahrenheit or separate offsets in late spring and plant in cactus potting mix. Depending on the viability of seed the germination rate is often up to 60-70%. Seeds must be sown in the well-drained growth media and covered lightly with the fine silica sand.",
    "frost": "Exposure to frost should be avoided so, if you are cultivating Aloe peglerae outdoors, try to protect it with little 'greenhouse-like' shelters.",
    "use": "With its tightly-packed, grey-green curved leaves, this aloe has an unmistakeable 'soccer ball' form which makes it one of the most interesting form plants available. In cultivation Aloe peglerae makes a stunning show especially in winter when there is little else in flower. The plants look good when planted in groups of three to five in natural grass vegetation as they appear in the veld. They can also be grown in large pots or in a rockery, if the drainage is good. Plant this aloe in a flat grassland garden, preferably creating a rock shelf effect around the aloes to keep the grass back. This is a sure way to create a garden of bizarre living sculptures! The flowers attract butterflies and sunbirds. Aloe peglerae is a slow-growing species, so it can be cultivated also in pots. It is an excellent plant for warm temperate climates that will take drought and moderate freezes.",

This Aloe has thick, stiff, non-bending pale blue-green leaves with sharp, widely spaced small reddish marginal teeth  and an overall ball-like, rounded form.",
    "description": "Aloe petricola is generally a stemless aloe, or a very short-stemmed aloe. This is usually a solitary, eventually suckering, aloe that can get a lot of blue coloration. Aloe petricola is a medium sized plant that grows fairly low to the ground reaching anywhere from 18-24 inches in height and can reach a little over a meter in width. The plants grow as single, densely leafy rosettes. The rosette has a rounded appearance caused by the upper parts of the leaves that are curved inwards. Rosette gives rise to bicolored racemes of white and orange. The leaves are greyish green and long, with broad bases and narrow tips. The leaves have occasional very small teeth on the upper leaf surface with usually more on the lower and sharp brown teeth along the margins. The colors on these plants are bright and vibrant, and they change as they begin to open, revealing more of the yellow color towards the bottom. It has a nice patina on it giving it the bluish color that can be rubbed off revealing the green beneath. Plants flower at a fairly early age (4-5 years from tiny seedling stage), but take another 3-5 years to start suckering.",
    "flowering": "This particular aloe is a flowering species with unique and distinct inflorescences, which make the plant easy to identify and distinguish from other Aloe plants. In mid to late winter appear the distinctly bicolored flowers, which are reddish orange in bud, opening to cream to pale yellow with faint green striped petals. In some forms though, the buds can be orange and the open flowers yellow. The inflorescences are tightly packed with dark brown anthers, and typically include at least two colors, usually a deep red towards the top where the buds are seen, and cream-yellow color at the bottom towards the base, reaching the stem of the flower. Inflorescences can reach about 4 feet, surpassing the height of the plant's fleshy leaves. In young plant there is just one inflorescence, while in older ones the inflorescence are 4-6. Flowers on the Aloe petricola plant are tube-shaped, about 30mm long and open from the bottom to the top.",
    "origin_history": "Aloe petricola has a fairly restricted distribution between 1,600 to 3,300 feet elevation where it is found in large colonies on rocky slopes and outcrops in the Eastern Transvaal in South Africa. The latin name petricola, means ‘inhabitant of rocky places’, referring to this aloe’s preferred habitat of sandstone slopes and granite outcrops The plant was first described in 1917 by South African botanist Dr Illtyd B. Pole-Evans (1877–1968). This species is not threatened and its population is stable.",
    "care_cultivation": "Plant in full to part sun in a well-drained soil and water occasionally to infrequently - quite drought tolerant. Aloe petricola is more tolerant to different types of soils than other Aloes; it grows in different soil types, from clay-like soils to sandy soils. For optimum growth, they need a well-drained soil with a pH that is either acidic, neutral (pH=7), or very slightly basic. The plants will benefit from a regular mulch of compost. Aloe petricola needs to be exposed to bright light. A combination of factors can lead to unhealthy plants; they include incorrect watering, poor drainage or too much shade. It can lead to attack by pests and diseases. Stressed plants are susceptible to white scale, aloe cancer, aloe rust and the aloe snout beetle. Pay attention not to wet the leaves while watering, because they are also sensitive to rotting. Aloe petricola grows easily from seed. Let the pods dry on the plant, and when completely dried, break open and collect the seeds.",
    "frost": "Aloe petricola is hardy to at least 25F., but to avoid damage in colder climates it’s better to protect it or move it indoors for the winter.",
    "use": "Aloe petricola is very popular for gardening because of its beautiful and radiant colors. Aside from its simple upkeep, this aloe grows quite well in cultivation and looks outstanding either on its own or bunched in groups.

    "slug": "aloe-pillansii",
    "aka": ["Aloidendron pillansii","Giant Quiver Tree","Bastard Quiver Tree","Kokerboom"],
    "overview": "Indigenous to southern Africa, Aloidendron pillansii (formerly Aloe pillansii) is a succulent tree that is impressively sculptured by time and the elements of the desert. This is one of the tallest and most prized of all the tree aloes; only Aloidendron barberae gets taller and more massive. As well as being beautiful, Aloe pillansii is also one of the most endangered plants in all of Africa. This succulent tree is noted to grow to 30 to 40 feet in habitat but likely grow to a much smaller size in cultivation.",
    "description": "Aloe pillansii features a robust trunk and erect branches holding large rosettes of arching silver-grey leaves with small pale yellow teeth on its margins. The leaves form a rosette, and are fleshy, greenish-white with jagged edges. Trees reach a stem height of 10m or more and a stem diameter ranging from 1-2m at the base narrowing to about 0.2m at the tip. The bark at the base is a yellowish to brownish golden color and peels away as the plant gets older leaving sharp edges along the lower half of the stem. Stems in old specimens have swollen bottle-shaped trunks that support the tall branches. The stem is covered with a white powdery substance which is particularly visible in younger specimens. The succulent leaves and roots as well as the swollen fibrous stems act as water reservoirs in times of drought and the grey powder on the stems reflects intense heat away from the plant. Aloidendron pillansii develops long stems that grows erect and away from the hot rocky terrain and this in itself helps to keep the leafy crowns cool. This is regarded as one of the largest of South Africa's tree aloes. Aloe pillansii is slow growing and may become a small sized tree in 30 years. Leaf margins have small white teeth of 1-2mm long and 5-8mm apart.",
    "flowering": "The branched inflorescence of A. pillansii develops from in-between the lowest leaves and hang down below the rosette (unlike those of the other tree aloes). The flowers which appear in mid spring are yellow and slightly swollen in the middle. The racemes are up to 150mm long and carry up to 30 yellow flowers at a time. The spherical capsules that ripen and split open into three parts to release the papery seeds that are dispersed by wind.",
    "origin_history": "Aloe pillansii is named after Neville S. Pillans, a well-known Cape botasnist who first collected Aloe pillansii. The common name comes from a translation of the Afrikaans name Kokerboom which translates as a quiver tree as the hollowed stems were used as a quiver for arrows. A. pillansii is confined to a small region of less than 200 square kilometers in north-western South Africa (the Richtersveld) and southwestern Namibia. There are probably fewer than 5,000 individuals (adult less than 200) of this species alive today, and distinct populations may be composed of only a few individuals. Aloidendron pillansii is arguably the scarcest of all tree aloes in southern Africa. It was previously called Aloe pillansii, however a new genus Aloidendron has been created for the tree aloes. This tree is synonymous with the extreme arid northwest of South Africa and the rugged mountainous parts of southern Namibia. It is regarded as critically endangered. According to the IUCN website they are not actively reproducing and the older plants are dying. Its main threats are poaching and habitat loss due to mining and other human related activities. The Aloe pillansii South African national tree number is 30.",
    "care_cultivation": "Aloe pillansii enjoys full sun in a well-drained soil. Irrigate little or not at all during the summer months and protect from frost below 25 F. Good rains on an annual basis are needed in the first 3–5 years after the seeds have germinated. It requires extremely well-drained rocky mineral soil, and very dry conditions. In habitat, it grows on rocky slopes in a desert region which receives its sparse rainfall predominantly in the winter. The roots have to be very well aerated, so to get it there is nothing like using sandy substrates like akadama, pomice or similar . Mix bone meal into the soil to help feed the fleshy roots of plants. In cultivation, Aloe pillansii may be somewhat smaller, and well-adaptable as a home garden specimen.",
    "frost": "It can handle temperatures down to 25 F.",
    "use": "Large potted giant quiver trees are very rewarding as they make beautiful specimens when positioned to enhance entrances, walls, courtyards, patios etc. It grows well in containers, but pressure from the root ball will easily break the container.",

    "aka": ["Aloe plicatilis","Kumara plicatilis","Fan Aloe","Cape Quivertree","Kaapse Kokerboom"],
    "overview": "Kumara plicatilis, formerly Aloe plicatilis, the fan-aloe, is a multi-branching shrub with highly textural gray bark endemic to a few mountains of the Western Cape in South Africa. With it's distinctive textural gray bark, fan-like clusters of leaves and branching stems, Aloe plicatilis is one of the most unique and striking of all of the aloes.",
    "description": "It may grow as a large multi-stemmed shrub or as a small tree. The stems are forked with clusters of strap-shaped leaves arranged in 2 opposite rows. It is a slow growing species with thick branching stems slowly growing 5-6 ft. tall and as wide. Exceptional large specimens in cultivation have been noted to 8 feet tall by 6 feet wide and plants from the wilds of the high winter rainfall areas of western Cape Mountains of South Africa are reportedly as tall as 15 feet. Old leaves drop cleanly away to expose the attractive smooth trunk. Trunks are thickened and gnarly in appearance with corky, fire-resistant bark. the branches fork into pairs without a central leader, a pattern known as 'dichotomous' branching. The branches bear masses of succulent, oblong, tongue-shaped leaves arranged in 2 opposite rows in the shape of a fan. The leaves are tightly clustered at the tips of the branches, with each branch producing one to two dozen leaves or so. The distinctive fan-like leaf clusters makes this species unique. The leaves are pale grey-green in color and have tiny teeth along the margins that are noticeable only on close inspection. The leaves are dusted with a thin waxy 'bloom' which gives them an attractive, frosted appearance. In strong light, the leaf margins may take on a pinkish blush. Leaves of Kumara plicatilis may grow to just over a foot in length, and to just under 2 inches wide at their widest. The leaf sap is clear. Even at a very small size (either a seedling, or a rooted cutting of a single fan) this is a very attractive plant. Kumara plicatilis is slow growing, so it will not quickly outgrow its allotted space, but with time, it will branch and re-branch, eventually growing into a good sized specimen plant.",
    "flowering": "The inflorescence of Aloe plicatilis is an erect 12 to 20 inch tall, un-branched raceme bearing cluster of tubular orange-red flowers in late winter to early spring. At the end of winter the plants appear to burst into flames as they suddenly produce masses of bright flowers. The racemes are cylindrical in shape. There are up to 30 tubular, scarlet flowers, each about 50 mm long and somewhat fleshy in texture. Aloe plicatilis blooms are loved by hummingbirds.",
    "origin_history": "This plant was previously called Aloe plicatilis. This aloe comes from the winter rainfall Western Cape where it can be found growing on steep, rocky slopes in well-drained soil that are typically acidic and found in association with other fynbos vegetation such as ericas and plants in the protea family. To correct this the plant was renamed by Philip Miller in 1768 using Linnaeus' varietal name for its specific one - this name from the Latin word ' plicatilis' meaning 'foldable' is in reference the fan-shaped rosettes. Kumara plicatilis derives its common name fan-aloe from its former placement in the genus Aloe and the unusual distichous arrangement of its linear leaves.",
    "care_cultivation": "It needs a sunny but cool and well-aerated (breezy) spot. As this plant grows on steep slopes in habitat, it requires very porous soil with excellent drainage. It is also best protected from the hot afternoon sun, particularly if it is in a container. In cultivation it should be grown in a slightly acidic soil medium with a pH of 5.5-6.5. Prune dead flower heads when needed, usually in early summer. If flower stalks have dried out, they can usually be removed by pulling rather than needing to use a hand pruner Needs winter and spring irrigation if grown where it does not receive adequate water from rainfall. In cooler regions, where this plant will not survive winter temperatures, it is best to grow this species as a potted plant, which ideally, should be moved outdoors during the warmer months to benefit from exposure to bright light, and rains, and moved back indoors when temperatures approach freezing.",
    "frost": "Growers in California and Arizona report that the fan aloe will survive temperatures to as low as about 24 degrees Fahrenheit, but recommend that plants should be protected from frost as much as possible.",
    "use": "Kumara plicatilis makes a wonderful feature in any garden and is an excellent accent plant. As such it is increasingly used as an ornamental plant for drought tolerant landscaping and rockeries. However it grows very slowly and consequently, outside of its natural habitat, it is often in danger of being overgrown, smothered and killed by faster growing plants in its vicinity. It also makes an attractive pot plant. In regions of the world which are frost free, or nearly so, this species is sometimes grown as a garden ornamental. This species attracts birds and provides pleasing winter time color.",

    "aka": ["French Aloe","Fransaalwyn","Garaa"],
    "overview": "Aloe pluridens, also known as the French Aloe, is a very attractive, slender tree aloe which bears gracefully backwards-bending leaves in large spiraled rosettes from South Africa. This aloe is well suited to coastal gardens, is usually single-stemmed and tall with specimens in habitat occasionally reaching 15 feet or more.",
    "description": "Aloe pluridens has large rosettes of gracefully recurved leaves. Its thin, recurved, light-green leaves form an elegant and symmetrical spiral in their growth around the rosette. Below the large (upper) rosette - papery dry leaves persist on the upper half of a woody stem, the slender lower part becoming bare and smooth. It may be single-stemmed or branched and occasionally bears numerous small plant-lets on the otherwise smooth stems. Solitary plants somewhat resemble small palms since they have similar silhouettes, and carry so many leaves and have thin, tall stems that do not hold the old leaves. The leaves are bright yellowish to bright green and are lined with large numbers of white teeth. Leaves are relatively small and delicate for a tree aloe. Younger plants have lighter, almost yellow-green leaves that can appear nearly translucent. It's sap is noted as having the sharp acrid smell of rhubarb. This is a moderately fast slow growing aloe, taking what may be decades to growing large/tall enough to flower, but with time can form extensive, convoluted branching colonies. Lotusland in Santa Barbara, CA has some of the nicest and most spectacular colonies of this plant.",
    "flowering": "Showy, branched inflorescences have up to 4 uniform-colored, cone-shaped racemes from each rosette. The flowers emerge from late fall to through winter, are un-curved, and a pink or dull scarlet color. Flowers are very similar to those of Aloe arborescens. Flowers usually dramatically rise about 2 feet above the head of the plant.",
    "origin_history": "This close relative of Aloe arborescens has a natural distribution along a wide area of the coast from the summer rainfall and frost free Eastern Cape to KwaZulu Natal in South Africa, where it often grows with heads of foliage popping out through dense foliage of lower growing shrubs. It was first described in 1824 by English botanist Adrian H. Haworth (1767-1833) from a plant collected by James Bowie (1789-1869) who later introduced it into cultivation in England in the 1820s. Bowie was a plant collector for the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. He undertook many expeditions and collected many plants, and contributed much to our knowledge of aloes and succulents. The species name means 'many toothed' and is derived from the Latin pluri meaning 'many' and dens meaning 'teeth', referring to the toothed leaves. The common name 'French Aloe' is a bit perplexing though Gilbert W. Reynolds in The Aloes of South Africa notes that this name came from its use in the Traskei region. In South Africa it has also been known by the common names Fransaalwyn and Garaa. It often grows in association with Aloe ferox, A. africana and A. speciosa, and hybrids can occur. Aloe pluridens native climate is moderate, without frost, and hot and humid during summers. They are usually seen growing on deep sandy soil. Aloe pluridens has been granted tree status and its national tree number is 30.1.",
    "care_cultivation": "In its natural thicket environment, the surrounding bushes protect the stems from heat and cold. Needs some semi-shade in really hot areas. Not one of the better aloes of dry deserts. It's important to remember that Aloe pluridens enjoys shelter as it is not a creature of the open plains and barren hillside like many others tree aloes. The old dead leaves will remain on the plant & hang down to protect the stem from heat & cold. But if you prefer a tidier look & live in a mild climate, the leaves can be removed with no problems. Although Aloe pluridens is drought tolerant, it thrives and flowers better if adequate irrigation is provided in the summer months. Grow in a soil that is well draining to help prevent diseases such as rot. Aloe pluridens is known to be less susceptible to snout beetle infestations. It is easily propagated by seed sown in spring-summer, or cuttings or truncheons taken in summer. Some plants form plantlets around the stem; these can be detached, placed in damp sand in a cool, semi-shaded spot until they root. Once rooted they can be potted up and grown on, or planted into the garden. Also easy to grow from cuttings.",
    "frost": "Hardy to about 28 F so protect from frost in colder locations.",
    "use": "Aloe pluridens makes a spectacular garden subject. It is well suited to coastal gardens, great along sea bluffs, and is suitable for containers. This is a very attractive and unusual shrubby aloe for the garden or for large containers and cut flower stems can last for up to three weeks in a vase. One of the better tree aloes for shady areas, and tolerates a good deal of moisture even in summers. They are oddly charming with their prehistoric looks and affinity with other, non-succulent plants. They are one of the easier aloes to fit into a general garden. Aloe pluridens has a high landscape value both as a feature plant where it can be planted as a single plant or as an extensive mass plantings to create a focal point or to define a boundary. Massed plantings provided a brilliant splash of color during the dry winter months. Aloe pluridens is a good source of nectar for birds and bees during the dry winter months.",

    "description": "Aloe pseudorubroviolacea has a Rosette of very wide, recurved leaves that look somewhat like those of Aloe rubroviolacea (hence the name), with a lot of color variation including blues, pinks, purples and of course greens. The rosette angle always seems to be tilted or facing completely horizontally. This very striking aloe looks a lot like the 'real' Aloe rubroviolacea. Maybe as a mature plant A. pseudorubroviolacea does not have the same violet color in full sun as it's namesake, but as a seedlng, has a strong violet, purply leaf coloration. Very neat, attractive and unusual looking aloe which crawls along the ground as it grows. Stems can get as long as 12 feet, and usually grow downhill. Leaves are green, gray-blue, or blue-red. In winter, the foliage takes on pink tone. A. pseudorubroviolacea is similar to A. rubroviolacea but larger and less prolific, with more branches on the inflorescence.",
    "flowering": "In it's native habitat Aloe pseudorubroviolacea flowers from winter though early spring. In California it's reportedly bloomed even later, often into summer. It's inflorescence is tall, multi-branched and has 1 inch long waxy orange-red, downward facing, flowers that are closely spaced. Rarely, Aloe pseudorubroviolacea may have yellow flowers.",
    "origin_history": "This aloe is restricted to high mountains and cliff faces between 6000 to 7000 feet in elevation that overlook the coastal plain of the Red Sea in provinces of Saudi Arabia. It was first described by John Lavranos & I.S. (Sheila) Collenette in 2000 in the Cactus and Succulent Society of America Journal. This species is related to 3 others from Arabia or Eritrea which have similar inflorescences: A. porphyrostachys (stemless), A. rubroviolacea (smaller, more prolific), and A. schoelleri (yellow to pinkish orange flowers).",
    "care_cultivation": "Plant in full sun in a well-drained soil - in its natural habitat this plant grows pendant or semi-pendant on steep slopes but can tolerate level ground if soil is well draining.

    "overview": "Aloe ramosissima is a larger Aloe to about 3 meters (9+ feet) tall with heavily branching, smooth stems and small crowns of narrow, glaucous leaves. This Aloe is from the winter rainfall area of Southern Africa's Namib Desert and occur in very arid, rocky places on hills and mountains. A well grown plant is among some of the most magnificent and ornamental of the 'tree-like' aloes.",
    "description": "It is a slow growing tree (shrub) type aloe known for its many branches and smooth, white stems, and without a doubt the most profusely branched of all aloes. The trunk is normally very short smooth and covered with strips of satiny, waxy, powdery silver-pink-brown colored bark, which acts as a sunscreen in the harsh climate. Branching continues as the plant becomes older, resulting in a dense, almost spherical shrub. The fleshy leaves and stems act as water reservoirs in times of drought and the grey powder on the stems reflect intense heat away from the plant. Aloe ramosissima are two to three meters in height with smooth stems terminate in small rosettes of leaves. Fleshy, oblong leaves, each up to 8 inches long and ¾ inch wide at their base make up the rosettes. Sometimes the leaves can manifest pink tinges, and the green color can become more or less yellowish depending on the exposure to the plant to direct sunlight. The margins have narrow edges with small brownish teeth; base encircling the stem. Other than this low branching habit and usually smaller leaf size, it is virtually identical to Aloe dichotoma, and some consider it a subspecies of A. dichotoma. They are long lived plants and once established, they will be content in their position and with their soil for years. Winter grower.",
    "flowering": "The inflorescences of Aloe ramosissima are short and sparsely branched with fairly large, tubular yellow flowers. The bright yellow flowers produce nectar which are generally pollinated by bees and ants. When capsules dry out, the winged seeds are carried by the wind, often landing in bushes where they germinate, making full use of the shelter and shade. Aloe ramosissima blooms in winter but the first flowers won't be produced util plants are about 10 to 15 old.",
    "origin_history": "Aloe ramosissima, now called Aloidendron ramosissimum, is an endemic species to the border region between South Africa and Namibia. This plant’s habitat are very arid, rocky places, like ravines or desert slopes. They rely on winter rains that average around 110 mm or less per annum. It is not at all uncommon in this area for summer temperatures to rise to 46º C and years may pass before any rain falls. This species is considered vulnerable, because its habitat is threatened by mining and overgrazing. The name 'ramosissima' means highly branched. Native to South Africa, the branches of this plant were used to make small quivers by young men who then gave these quivers to young ladies as a sign of their affection. Aloe ramosissima's South African national tree number is 30.2. Aloe ramosissima is a rare and endangered species in habitat.",
    "care_cultivation": "This is one of the aloes that sometimes can resent excessive summer watering ,and much prefers to get its water in winter (potted plants are particularly prone to rot if watered in summers). Aloe ramosissima requires a well-drained sandy soil to prevent roots rotting. Pay attention not to wet the leaves while watering, because they are also sensitive to rotting. Before each watering, it’s better to wait until the soil is completely dry.",
    "frost": "Aloe ramosissima is hardy to 28°F (-1°C) but to avoid damage it's better to protect it if you keep it outdoors, or move it indoors if you keep it in a pot.",
    "use": "Perfect for the dry tropical or warm temperate garden in USDA Zones 9 and above. In mild climates, Aloe ramosissima is useful as a specimen plant in a rock desert gardens. It is also suitable a large container grown houseplant in a bright location. Put in a pot and correctly pruned, this plant become really interesting as an ornamental plant for indoors spaces.

The flowers of Aloe arborescens are deep orange, almost red; there are also pure yellow flowering forms of this aloe.  The inflorescences are usually unbranched and conical with two or more arising from a single rosette. The large flower spikes bloom in Winter and will help brighten up a dull winter garden.",
    "origin_history": "This species has an extensive natural distribution in southern Africa, from Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi south through eastern South Africa, and then westward in a strip along the coast nearly to Cape Town. Aloe arborescens has adapted to many different habitats, its natural habitat usually consists of mountainous areas including rocky outcrops and exposed ridges. Its habitat can vary and is one of only a few species of aloe that is found growing from sea level up to the tops of mountains. Much of its natural range receives summer or year-round rainfall. The plant's name means 'becoming a tree' for this plant's large stature, though a bit misleading as this plant is a large shrub.",

    "aka": ["Torch Plant", "Lace Aloe", "Guinea-fowl Aloe", "Bearded Aloe"],
    "overview": "The Lace Aloe, Aloe aristata, is a low-growing, small, clumping aloe native to South Africa and Lesotho. This aloe a stemless, no more than 8 to 12 inches (20 to 30 cm) tall, with dense rosettes of stubby, lance-shaped, dark green leaves which look similar to a Haworthia. Lace Aloe is a vigorous grower and because it grows in a variety of habitats it can tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions.",
    "description": "Aloe aristata is stemless and produces triangular, dark grey-green leaves densely packed in a rosette around the base of the plant. The leaves of this rosette are thickly lined with white cilia and a dense smattering of white bumps makes it resemble its relatives in the Haworthia genus. It is a small plant, usually growing to about 15 to 20cm (6-8 inch) in a tight rosette formation. The margins of the leaves are lined with white horny materials and minutely toothed with short, soft white spines. Its fleshy leaves retain water allowing the plant to get through periods of drought without trouble. If given room to spread, Lace Aloe will produce numerous new offsets around its base.",
    "flowering": "Starting in summer and into the fall Aloe aristata will produce showy 12 - 18 inches tall branched inflorescence. The tubular orange-red to pink flowers don’t produce a scent and may not last very long but it's nectar does attract bees and hummingbirds. The Lace Aloe's flowers are a wonderful addition to the arid garden.",
    "origin_history": "Aloe aristata belongs to the Aristaloe genus of flowering plants native to South Africa and so appears similar to the Haworthia genus. It is native to mountains grassland of South Africa and is therefore best suited to warm, dry conditions.",
    "care_cultivation": "Try planting this in-ground or in a pot to be kept outdoors in partial sun or indoors near a sunny window. Wherever you plant it, be sure that it has excellent drainage and avoid watering unless the soil is completely dry. There is no need to water this aloe during winter. If grown outdoors, choose a spot with filtered sunlight and avoid strong, direct sunlight. When grown indoors, consider choosing a west-facing or east-facing window. Indoor growth requires normal room temperature. Dry and well drained gritty soils will keep the Aloe aristata healthy. This genus is well known for its ease of cultivation, but they are sensitive to excessive irrigation.",
    "frost": "One of the few frost hardy aloes. Hardy to 5 F.",
    "use": "Grown primarily for its attractive succulent rosettes of yellow spots on green leaves with soft white spines. Best planted in the rock garden in a vertical crevice to help the rosettes shed winter moisture. This plant can also be planted in masses to create a slow growing ground cover. The Lace Aloe makes a great choice for patio gardens, small gardens and works well as a house plant.",

    "overview": "Aloidendron barberae is Africa's largest aloe-like plant that grows into a tree ranging from 30 to 50 feet tall or more with upright-growing thick mottled gray stems. This South African native is a striking sculptural tree aloe with grey, smooth, bark bearing a rounded, neat crown and salmon pink flowers in winter.",
    "description": "Aloidendron barberae is Africa's largest aloe reaching up to 15 meters in height and 0.9 meters (3 feet) in stem diameter. This tree-size aloe eventually develops massive trunks and branches. It forms a stout trunk that can eventually grow over 2.5m in diameter and usually has a broad 'foot' at ground level. The bark of the tree-trunks is grayish-brown and rough to the touch. The branching is forked or dichotomous and eventually forms a spreading, rounded crown. The stems branch out carrying rosettes of deeply channeled, recurved dark green leaves which are sheathed at the base. Leaves are long, very rubbery and flexible, though break easily when bent too far. The leaf margins are cartilaginous with small whitish teeth. Tree aloe is a slow growing species; young plants are awkward in character, but eventually become unique garden plants.",
    "flowering": "In winter the Inflorescence of Aloidendron barberae can be 500mm in length (20 inches), has up to 3 branches, and range in color from rose-pink in the South to apricot-orange in the north. It's inflorescence is seldom longer than the rosettes and may be hidden amongst the leaves. The racemes are cylindrical and its flowers have a swollen, tubular shape. Aloe barberae is the only tree aloe with orangey pink flowers. The flowers are pollinated by birds and will also attract bees and other insects, which in turn, attract insect eating birds. The capsules ripen in late spring and release their seeds, which are dispersed by wind.",
    "origin_history": "It is native to South Africa northwards to Mozambique. Aloidendron barberae was first collected and submitted for classification by Mary Elizabeth Barber, who was a plant collector in the former Transkei who sent specimens of the plant and its flowers to the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew and it was named in her honor. The same plant was also sent to Kew in 1873 by the explorer and painter Mr. Thomas Baines who collected it in Natal. Subsequently it was named Aloe bainesii. Although known as A. bainseii for many years, Aloe barberae was the name first given to this plant, and takes precedence according to the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature, and so is the epithet used in the combination Aloidendron barberae. The genus Aloe was reassessed and split into a few genera in 2013. The genus Aloidendron, meaning 'tree aloe' was formed and includes all the tree aloes, recognising that they are more closely related to each other than to other aloes. Its habitat is occurs in dense, tall bush and subtropical coastal forests, kloofs and dry valleys in the summer rainfall eastern regions of southern Africa.",
    "care_cultivation": "The tree aloe is easy to grow in gardens as long as it is planted in full sun or light shade in a fairly well drained soil (on a slope is best) and irrigated only occasionally. In the wild it grows in loamy, humus rich soils, so plant it with added compost and mulch yearly. If pruning to shape when young, best to prune only small branches. Old larger diameter branches do not heal well. Very old specimens can develop hollow branches or trunks, so check for signs of this for safety. Best planted in spring. Very low maintenance. It thrives in cultivation and is easily propagated just remember to provide enough space for its eventual size. The leaves may be attacked by aphids and scale insects. Prone to mealy bug, too, if grown in any shade. Waterlogged soil can lead to attacks by pest and diseases. This plant is easily propagated from stem cuttings or truncheons, which are allowed to dry for a couple of days before being planted out.",
    "frost": "This species is native to coastal zones of eastern South Africa where it grows in frost free valleys on well draining sites. Hardy to about 25 degrees F and reportedly survives short durations down to 22 degrees F. It will tolerate light frost if it is planted in a protected place, covered for the first few years and kept on the dry side in winter.",
    "use": "It is a great tree for the succulent garden and is fairly clean so good near a pool and can be kept many years in a large container. It does get a thick buttressed base with age so make sure to given it enough space to grow. It has a shallow-spreading, non-aggressive root system but enough space should be provided for its eventual size, especially its massive stem base, and therefore should not be planted close to any buildings. The tree aloe is often used as an ornamental plant. It makes an excellent focal point in the garden and is great to plant in bold clumps in both garden and office parks. The 'Tree Aloe' may be the perfect centerpiece for a rock garden, raised planter or on a garden slope. This fast growing tree aloe is used for its architectural shape and thrives in cultivation.",

    "overview": "Aloe reitzii is a rather rare species of stemless Aloe which is summer blooming and endemic to South Africa’s grassland area of Mpumalanga. This beautiful robust stemless plant usually has a single rosette 3 feet tall. This aloe produces handsome cylindrical racemes of dark red to orange-red flowers and has long relatively broad silvery blue-green leaves with reddish teeth along the margins.",
    "description": "Aloe reitzii forms a nice, single, silvery blue-green rosette to 3 feet tall & wide with reddish-brown teeth along the leaf margins. The leaves are quite thick, long, and broad being up to 4 inches wide at the base and tapering to a point. Leaf surfaces are smooth except for a line of thorns that appear near the tip of the lower leaf surface. The Aloe reitzii leaf margins are armed with sharp reddish-brown teeth that are 3mm long. Plants are definitely full sun species and fairly slow growing, taking 5-10 years to mature to flowering size. Can often be confused with Aloe gerstneri and Aloe petricola.",
    "flowering": "In the summer the spectacular inflorescence branches near its base with each stem becoming a vertical spike rising well above the foliage. Young plants may produce only one raceme but older plants can produce multiple racemes, further enhancing a spectacular sight. It is unusual because of its downturned flowers and because it blooms in summer, while most other Aloes are winter blooming. This summer flowering habit makes it a useful subject for cold gardens where the flowers of other aloes often get frosted off in the cold winter months. Long dense racemes of flowers are a showy pinky-red opening to yellow. Curved flowers are long, narrow and tubular in shape, up to 50mm in length, dark red but gradually turning yellow in color.",
    "origin_history": "This plant has a restricted distribution in a very small area on rocky slopes in the grasslands near the Belfast district of Mpumalanga in northern KwaZulu-Natal. This aloe is endemic to this area and occurs nowhere else in the world. There is also a winter-blooming form of this plant called Aloe reitzii var. vernalis that comes from The Vryheid District to the north. Plant named in 1943 to honor Francis William Reitz, then the South African Minister of Agriculture.",
    "care_cultivation": "Reitz' aloe is not difficult to cultivate and makes a handsome addition to any garden. It tolerates both frost and fire in its natural habitat, and is easily propagated from seed although the seed is often in short supply. Fresh seed should be sown in spring on a well-drained seedling medium, lightly covered and treated with a fungicide. Seedlings will emerge after two to four weeks and can be transplanted at the age of six months into individual containers ensuring good drainage and full sun conditions. Seed grown plants may take five to seven years from sowing to flower.",
    "frost": "Aloe reitzii is a relatively cold hardy species. Acccording to Brian Kemble this plant has proven hardy in cultivation at the Ruth Bancroft Garden down to 20F.",
    "use": "A great plant for the dry garden or as a container specimen though seed grown plants can take up to 7 years to mature and begin blooming. One of the few spectacular colors in the early autumn aloe garden.",

Grows up to 2 feet tall with leaves that are a pale green color with white spots on both the upper and lower surfaces and leaf margins. This species superficially resembles Aloe striata.",
    "description": "Aloe reynoldsii is a low-growing succulent without a stem or with very short stems, with leaves gathered in a rosette. The plant grows up to 650 mm (2 feet) tall, usually occurring singly or in small groups of 3 to 20 plants in their habitat. It is usually covered of dry leaves, which don’t detach from the stem. Aloe reynoldsii is one of the stemless spotted leaf aloes that is very like Aloe striata except for the flower color and the subtle mottling of the leaves. The leaves are bluish-green, elongated, fleshy, with longitudinal lines and with numerous pale green spots and tiny whitish teeth on the margins. The leaves are relatively wide and blue-green with white longitudinal stripes and numerous H-shaped marks. Leaves can feel waxy in texture. Leaf margins are wavy, with a pink or white cartilaginous border.",
    "flowering": "This species blooms in mid winter to spring, with yellow to yellow-orange tubular flowers, slightly swollen at the base in a multi-branched, 2 foot tall inflorescence. The sparsely branched inflorescence, unlike most Aloes, is not a raceme (which is like a cluster of flowers), but instead a panicle. A panicle is an inflorescence that reminds one of an umbrella because of its shape. The flowers are almost all on the same layer which is curved like an umbrella. The flowers of Aloe reynoldsii are relatively small. Seed capsules are about 220 mm long and 100 mm in diameter.",
    "origin_history": "Aloe reynoldsii has a very restricted natural distribution in a unique habitat on sheer south-facing shale cliffs along the Mbashe River around 1000 to 2000 feet in elevation near Idutywa in the Eastern Cape of South Africa. This area has hot summers and cooler, dry winters with rainfall occurring mainly in summer. Aloe reynoldsii was named in honor of the well-known Aloe specialist, G.W. Reynolds (1895–1967). Another common name is Yellow Spineless Aloe. Aloe reynoldsii is listed as Rare in the Red List of South African plants. It has a very restricted distribution and a very specialized habitat. Major threats are invasion of its habitat by Lantana camara and illegal collecting for horticulture, however, most of its population is inaccessible, because of its cliff-face habitat and it is not believed to be threatened. Often it grows in cracks between boulders along with other succulent plants like Crassula falcata, in frost-free areas with a high humidity factor.",
    "care_cultivation": "Aloe reynoldsii is a plant that likes sun, but does not do well in blazing, hot, arid full sun. Plant is coastal full sun to part sun inland in a well-drained soil. It grows well in semi-shaded areas with morning sunlight and afternoon shade. A. reynoldsii prefers not to have wet roots in winter months so soil must drain well and any additional irrigation withheld during a typical wet California winter. Pay attention not to wet the leaves while watering, because they are also sensitive to rotting. During hot weather, water once a week and twice a month in normal summer temperatures. When mature plants are removed from the soil, or are being transplanted into bigger pots, leave the plant out of the soil for 2 to 3 days to dry and cut off the old roots to prevent rotting of the root system and promote growth of new roots.",
    "frost": "Hardy to around 27 F, so may need protection from moderate frost.",

This small, clumping aloe produces 2 foot tall branched, flat-topped inflorescences of showy yellow/orange flowers all year.",
    "description": "One of the best results of aloe hybridization so far is realized in A. 'Rooikappie' (pronounced roy-copy, Afrikaans for Little Red Riding Hood). If one were to choose the characteristics of the ideal landscape aloe, many of them would be represented in this plant. The growth of Aloe 'Rooikappie' is fairly compact with a clumping form of stems/leaves 12 inches long, greenish with attractive spots. Plants are stemless, slow to offset and have stiff, unbendable leaves that vary from a dull deep green to maroon. The 30 cm (12 inch) rosettes of Aloe 'Rooikappie' are large enough to make an impact in a small landscape or can be massed for larger-scale displays. Maximum diameter seems to be about 18 inches. Pups freely with new offsets creating a nice clump very fast. Its foliage is attractively spotted and is not prone to the tip die-back or other blemishes that seem to plague many other medium-sized aloes. It has great color in high heat and full sun (reddish-brown with prominent spotting) on flattish leaves. Teeth prominent and sharp. Stems grow upwards then recurved at tips.",
    "flowering": "When you see a photo of the inflorescence, you'll understand the name. The flowers at the tip of the flower stem are massed together in the shape of a hood. Mature plants seem to flower periodically all year round in mild climates but is especially prolific in the fall. Arizona and low desert locations will see this species stop blooming during the hottest summer months. Blooms lasts a long time-several weeks usually depending on your weather. Aloe 'Rooikappie' has an attractive flower spike that reaches 18 to 24 inches tall with many orange pendant bell shaped blooms near the top that later turn darker yellow. Flowers themselves are conical in shape and highly symmetrical while developing.",
    "origin_history": "This is a wonderful hybrid created by Cynthia Giddy many years ago, not to be confused with the very similar hybrid named after her (a slight larger plant with less perfectly symmetrical flowers). Giddy was a South African conservationist, horticulturist and author of 'The Cycads of South Africa' (Purnell & Sons,1974 ). She was a noted authority on clivia, aloe and African cycads and maintained a nursery in Natal, South Africa. Giddy offered a number of Aloe hybrids and cultivars in the catalogs of her Umlaas Aloe Nursery—this one as early as 1974. The name 'rooikappie' translates in Afrikaans as 'little red cap' and was the name used for the for Grimm's fairy tale 'Little Red Riding Hood'. Aloe 'Rooikappie' Giddy is sometimes sold under the name, Aloe rudikoppe or as 'Little Gem'. Also known as the Little Red Riding Hood aloe. This plant was distributed by the Huntington Botanical Gardens.",

    "title": "Aloe rubroviolacea",
    "slug": "aloe-rubroviolacea",
    "aka": ["Arabian Aloe"],
    "overview": "Aloe rubroviolacea is appreciated by many as one of the more spectacular aloes available. Not a super common aloe, but one of the more striking ones in full sun where large, fat succulent, blue-green leaves that can turn a violet color and form 2 foot wide rosettes which arch gracefully outward. This aloe comes from steep and rocky areas above 7,000 feet elevation in the mountains of Yemen and Saudi Arabia on the Arabian Peninsula.",
    "description": "A sprawling succulent that forms beautiful 2 foot rosettes of thick, fleshy, blue green leaves atop slow-growing stems. Over time these stems elongate while new shoots emerge at their base where old leaves have dried and fallen off, forming sprawling clumps to 6 feet wide by 3 feet tall. Aloe rubroviolacea ends up looking like a 'crawling' aloe although it sometimes will form an upright stem. Leaves are a glaucous, blue-green in partial shade, with contrasting reddish margins, the leaves get purple tinged in full sun. In winter, the foliage takes on pink tones, which is the reason for the specific epithet 'rubraviolacea' meaning 'red-violet'. This Yemeni aloe has leaves with small yellow to orange, hooked teeth on their margins that are not very sharp. The leaves have a fluorescent green sap which dries a dark violet color and can stain concrete and clothing. Leaves even dry a dark, deep purple before turning the typical brown of a dead aloe leaf. It's a vigorous grower in mild climates, and makes an attractive addition to a succulent garden. It also is not a prolific offsetter. Seedlings will end up being attractive adults in just 2-4 years. Most growers of aloes find this one of the most spectacular and rewarding of all the aloes one can grow.",
    "flowering": "Similar to A. pseudorubroviolacea but smaller and more prolific, with fewer branches on the inflorescence. Inflorescences are tall and unbranched (or with one branch), with 1 inch long flowers. Flowers are somewhat compact, beehive-shaped structures on solitary or reluctantly branching inflorescences on very thick stalks. This aloe begins blooming in late fall with spikes of waxy orange-red flowers. Dense spires of the rather large, tubular flowers continue into winter making a great show each year. Although the plant is fairly hardy, the flowers are not and they will be damaged by frost so protect them from freezing temperatures for the best floral display.",
    "origin_history": "This aloe comes from steep and rocky areas above 7,000 feet elevation in the mountains of Yemen and Saudi Arabia on the Arabian Peninsula.",
    "care_cultivation": "Plant in full sun in a well-drained soil - in its natural habitat this plant grows pendant or semi-pendant on steep slopes but can tolerate level ground if soil is well draining. Protect from snails which can disfigure the attractive leaves.",
    "frost": "The plant is fairly hardy with foliage remaining undamaged down to 20° F and even resprouting from underground stems after colder temperatures but the winter flowers will freeze if temperatures drop much below 32°F. However, flowers were severely damaged.",
    "use": "Excellent specimen plant for both standard gardens and very steeply sloping ones (good one to plant so stems head downhill).",

    "title": "Aloe rupestris",
    "slug": "aloe-rupestris",
    "aka": ["Bottlebrush Aloe", "Rosary Vine"],
    "overview": "Aloe rupestris is a robust fast growing mostly single stemmed tree aloe with very showy flowers. The Aloe species that in fact carries the moniker, Bottlebrush Aloe, is quite spectacular but is nowhere near as popular a garden plant as it should be, given its ease of growing. Gradually matures into a sturdy trunked tree aloe, topped by a spiraling rosette that produces Candelabra-like 4 foot stalks covered in a bright yellow-to-gold-to-red conical racemes in Winter.",
    "description": "Mature specimens of Aloe rupestris have a relatively thin, unbranched trunk on top of which sits a compact, spiraled, rosette of thick succulent, blue grey leaves. In habit it resembles the related A. thraskii and A. excelsa, which also produce rather top-heavy rosettes atop an unbranched trunk. The stem (trunk) is sturdy to support the leaf structure and can reach a height of up to 8 meters. Mature plants carry many dried leaves that cover the upper part of the stem, giving it a rather shaggy appearance. These help to protect the stem from fires and hot sun, and even though they are unlikely to face a fire within a garden setting, should not be seen as an untidy part of the plant in need of removal. Although they can grow to 8 meters it more commonly will grow to about 3 meters in cultivation. Leaves are stiff, long, narrow, moderately channeled, straight to slightly incurved, a deep dull green and incredibly armed with extremely sharp, often hooked red-brown teeth. This is among one of the most dangerous tree aloes to walk by (until leaves over your head)- will easily and readily tear off any exposed flesh brushed up against them. Leaves of the bottle-brush aloe spread out in a spiral formation, have a smooth surface and curve downwards (re-curved). Offsetting forms have been favored in cultivation. In its natural habitat Aloe rupestris grows in bushes or next to a tree which gives support during strong winds. Aloe rupestris has a spread-root-system the roots are somewhat fleshy.",
    "flowering": "What is remarkable about Aloe rupestris are its 1 or 2 candelabra-form inflorescences up to 1.25 meters (4 feet) tall above the leaf rosette that bear 6-15 or more erect, cylindrical racemes. In late winter to early spring appear the sturdy inflorescence bearing many bottlebrush-like spikes of flowers that start out as tight masses of bright yellow buds that burst open to become completely overshadowed by the brilliant orange-red, exerted stamens. When they open, bright reddish stamens extend far out, and give each raceme a fluffy 'bottlebrush' look. The blooms are not long lasting but an amazing display that looks more like a Banksia flower than an aloe when in full bloom. Aloe rupestris is probably the most fluorescent of all the tree aloe flowers. It looks like psychedelic bottle brush from a distance. The individual flowers begin as tight yellow buds that are packed densely on the racemes.",
    "origin_history": "The plant name 'rupestris' means 'growing in rocky places' and refers to its habitat. The Bottlebrush Aloe gets its common name from its distinctive and showy flowers. Aloe rupestris occurs naturally across the south-eastern summer-rainfall areas of Kwazulu-Natal Province, South Africa, as well as Swaziland and southern Mozambique. Within this range, it favors rocky areas in bushveld, sandy coastal forest, and hilly areas where it occurs on rocky ridges and slopes. The region is frost free and day temperatures reach around 38C. The species is not considered to be threatened in its habitat. Aloe rupestris is closely related to Aloe excelsa and Aloe thraskii. Aloe rupestris has been given tree status in South Africa and its national tree number is 30.3.",
    "care_cultivation": "Aloe rupestris is easy to grow, requiring very little care. Plant in full sun in a well-draining soil and irrigate occasionally to regularly - this aloe can take it dry or with abundant summer irrigation, so long as the soil drains well. When watering allow soil to dry out between waterings. Though drought tolerant, regular Summer water will pay off in steady growth (expect a gain of 1-2' per year) - which may eventually require a bit of support for the stalk. It tolerates weekly watering in the summer; once a month, or not at all in the colder months of December and January. At least in California, this plant nearly always is a super aggressive off-setter, unlike any other in the tree aloe family. Aloe rupestris is susceptible to Mealy bugs and white scale. These plants do not like over watering or insufficient sun, both of which will lead to an increased susceptibility to disease. Aloe rupestris has fairly slender stems and can be a little top heavy, particularly when in bloom, so staking may be in order as it gets taller; in its natural habitat it grows in dense shrub thickets which provide support. Propagated almost exclusively by seeds planted in autumn, in trays of coarse river sand. They thrive in alkaline soils; ash and lime additions are useful. These are relatively fast growers, going from 8 inch seedlings to 5 foot tall plants in about 6-7 years.",
    "frost": "It is also one of the hardier of the large aloes, tolerating temperatures down to at least 25°F with minimal leaf damage but it’s still best to avoid planting in areas with prolonged periods of frost.",
    "use": "Aloe rupestris has beautiful flowers and makes a welcome addition to any garden. In mild climates it can be cultivated outdoors for use in landscaping, preferably planting it in hot and dry gardens. Fairly fast and easily grown in warm temperate and tropical climates in USDA Zones 9 to 11. The Bottlebrush Aloe is well suited to rock gardens, and at the edges of forest, grassland and bushveld, and will take a little bright shade during a hot summer. It can be grown in large containers. It’s a great way to add evergreen, vertical fascination & dramatic mid-Winter color to your garden. Aloe rupestris is popular with birds, bees & butterflies who find it's flowers impossible to resist.",

    "description": "Aloe sabaea is a curious plant having long, very droopy, pale green to grey-green leaves (deeper green in shady conditions) that sometimes droop all the way to the ground. Rarely a leaf or two will extend laterally, but most almost cling to the stem, through plants are often growing at an angle, possibly due to wind influence and a bit of top-heaviness. Plants would fit in a Dr. Seuss scene perfectly. Stems do not retain old leaves. Leaves have whitish, bluntish marginal teeth.",
    "flowering": "Flowers in winter are on very open racemes on multibranched inflorescences, varying from dark red to yellow-orange and are relatively wide and short for aloe flowers, their stamens and styles protruding slightly from the ends. The flowers of Aloe sabaea appear on tall upright inflorescences in open conical racemes on a plant that can reach 8 to 12 feet tall and 3 to 4 feet wide.",
    "origin_history": "This unusual plant comes from remote areas of Yemen and southern Saudi Arabia where it grows at an intermediate elevation in stony barren soils. The plant's name 'sabaea' comes from the Roman name for Arabia Felix, the area we now call Yemen and was also called Sheba in the King James version of the bible. This plant was described and named by Georg Agustus Schweinfurth in 1894. Schweinfurth was a German botanist and ethnologist who travelled throughout East Central Africa and the Saudi Arabian peninsula. He found it during his travels growing in sunny, stony, barren soils.",

    "description": "Aloe secundiflora is a plastic-like plant with unbendable shiny leaves which rarely offsets. Usually an acaulescent rosette of spreading, glossy, dull glaucous green leaves. The leaves are usually slightly recurved at the tips. Young plants often have spots on their leaves, especially the undersides. Has a deep cup on cross section and moderately sharp, large, red-brown teeth along the leaf margins. Leaf color from light green to maroon and often a variety of colors within same leaf when they receive more sun. Color of leaves in hot summer is bronze, though some plants are bronzer in fall.",
    "flowering": "The 1 meter tall, branched inflorescence of Aloe secundiflora has up to 20 spreading branches, each with a cylindrical raceme of flowers. The flowers themselves are simple and may vary in color from red-pink to pale pink. Aloe secundiflora flowering times seem to be variable though most flowering goes on from mid winter to early spring.",
    "origin_history": "Produces a beautiful inflorescence with flowers turned upright along mostly lateral flowering stalks (hence the species epithet). Aloe secundiflora is native to grassland and open woodland on rocky soils in Tanzania between 750 and 2000 m. In some areas, wild plants are harvested on a sustainable basis and the same plants can be used for many years. In areas where there is no established tradition of harvesting, wild plants are frequently destroyed while collecting the exudate. Its sap is widely used medicinally, the roots in brewing local beer.",
    "care_cultivation": "Although Aloe secundiflora is drought tolerant it needs water to develop new leaves. Plant in full sun in a well-drained soil. Irrigate in summer months and try to keep drier in winter. The plant is well adapted to dry semi-arid conditions in the tropics and subtropics Seems to like sun or shade, but flowers best in sun.

    "overview": "Aloe speciosa is a generally single-stemmed, tall succulent growing up to 10 feet (3 m) that carries its massive rosettes of leaves at a tilt off to one side. The Tilt-head Aloe is a handsome tree-like succulent having decorative blue-green leaves with deep pink to pale red, serrated leaf margins, and dense cylindrical flower heads of red buds, opening greenish white in spring-summer.",
    "description": "What makes Aloe speciosa easy to distinguish is that the head of the rosette of leaves is almost always tilted to one side toward the direction of greatest sun exposure. This tall arborescent aloe grows to 15 feet or more with a single rosette of grayish green leaves at the top. Trunk is usually unbranched and covered by dried leaves. The slender long (to 36 inch) bluish-green leaves have a pinkish tinge at their tips and leaf margins, which also have tiny, soft, pale to deep red teeth. It often grows in association with Aloe ferox, A. africana and A. pluridens, and hybrids can occur.",
    "flowering": "In mid-winter to early spring appear the short, 1 foot (30 cm) long, cone-like inflorescences that rise and branch close to the crown of the rosette. The inflorescence is solitary (unbranched), but one rosette can produce up to four inflorescences. The cylindrical raceme is about 500 mm long, densely packed with flowers. The buds are a deep red when young and mature to green with white stripes. When the flowers open, the dark brownish-orange stamens and style protrude conspicuously from the tips of the flowers. As they open in succession from the bottom to the top, the entire bloom is tri-colored. The peduncle is short, about 120 mm long, and covered at the base by papery bracts.",
    "origin_history": "The tilt-head aloe is so named because of the way that its rosette tilts to one side, in the direction of the greatest sun. The Latin name 'speciosa' means showy, and was actually given in reference to its ornamental flowers. The species is also known as Aloe hexapetala - also in reference to its flowers ('hexa-petala' means 'six-petaled'). The tilt-head aloe is found in two disjunct spots. It occurs in the south-central part of the Western Cape province, from near Swellendam to the Little Karoo. It also occurs over a large part of the southern Eastern Cape province as far as the border of the Transkei, South Africa. Here its habitat is often dense thickets, especially the Albany Thicket biome.",
    "care_cultivation": "Aloe speciosa is best planted in a sunny situation. Rockeries are ideal. It requires full sun and good drainage. Establishment is important; water well initially to encourage maximum root growth. It is an adaptable plant and will grow in various soil types, although it prefers a fertile, sandy loam soil. The soil can be slightly acid to alkaline, and must be well-drained. Enrich the soil with ample bonemeal and provide an annual compost dressing. Once established the plant should be self-sustaining. When growing in exposed or harsh conditions it is usually smaller, and often single-stemmed.",
    "frost": "Aloe speciosa is considered to be tender to frost since temperatures in its native habitat rarely are below 28 F.",

It's a South African native that grows on a trunk as a shrub to 4 to 6 feet tall and can be solitary but more often clusters. This sounds a lot like many other tree aloes, but Aloe spicata is branching which sets it apart.",
    "description": "Aloe spicata has a few 3 foot wide, dense rosettes of long gracefully recurved and relatively narrow leaves that gradually taper to a point. The leaves of Aloe spicata are deeply guttered on the upper surface and are a bright green color attractively infused with orange-pink to red tones, particularly near the margins. Leaves often turn entirely coppery-red in dry conditions. Leaves are stiff, arching tapering and spineless. Margins are a deep pink to reddish color with spreading, horny, deltoid-cuspidate teeth 1-2(-4) mm long and 8–15 mm apart. The leaves are not nearly as long and tapering as in species like Aloe alooides and Aloe thraskii. A great looking aloe which is a must have for collectors looking for foliage color more than the modest flower color. Aloe spicata is well-known for its neat habit, and low-maintenance. Very similar to A. tauri (Zimbabwe) which grows a much shorter stem, also to A. castanea (South Africa) which can grow a taller stem.",
    "flowering": "Aloe spicata flowers in late winter to early spring and are solitary, long, compact columnar racemes that cover about 70% of the length of the entire inflorescence. This Aloe may have up to five, one meter tall inflorescences per rosette. Aloe spicata is named after the shape of the inflorescence, which emerge as densely flowered spikes The flowers are brown-yellow and have a shaving brush appearance owing to the dense inflorescence and long stamens. The long unbranched racemes are covered with dense, sessile, yellow-green flowers which appear yellow-orange due to their bright orange prominent stamens. Flowers have a brownish nectar which attracts birds and insects. Multiple heads in bloom can be quite striking. The flowers open from the bottom up with a wave of orange exerted stamens and great quantities of sticky brownish nectar.",
    "origin_history": "The native habitat of Aloe spicata is steep slopes from sea level to over one mile in altitude in Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Swaziland and the northeastern provinces of South Africa. It was originally described by Linnaeus in 1781 with the plants name referencing its spike-shaped inflorescence with sessile flowers. Other common names include Bullocks Bottle-brush Aloe, Lemombo aloe and Spike-flowered Aloe. The plant later described as Aloe sessiliflora is now considered to be a synonym. Aloe spicata has been used for medicinal purposes, chiefly as a purgative. Most often seen in botanical gardens under the synonym Aloe sessiliflora, this species was introduced in cultivation in 1795.",
    "care_cultivation": "Aloe spicata is an easy and rewarding plant that usually does not give many problems in cultivation. Plant in full sun to light shade in a well-drained soil and irrigate only occasionally to infrequently; the drier it is kept the redder it will be. Aloe spicata is well-known for its neat habit, and low-maintenance. Growing Aloe spicata in a spot in full sun where water can be withheld after a good rooting in period, is ideal.",
    "frost": "Aloe spicata is hardy to light / moderate frost of about 25 F.",
    "use": "Very nice in medium to large sized succulent gardens. Also works well in hillside plantings and can be used as an informal hedge. Interesting when planted among flowing grasses. Low maintenance and low litter make it a nice plant near swimming pools, keeping in mind leaves have short teeth so it should be kept clear of foot traffic. This colorful foliage can provide striking seasonal interest in the garden. They make excellent subjects for close up photography, especially when that nectar reflects or transmits the light.",

    "title": "Aloe spinosissima",
    "slug": "aloe-spinosissima",
    "aka": ["Spider Aloe", "Dwarf Aloe","Gold Tooth Aloe"],
    "overview": "The Aloe x spinosissima South African hybrid is one of the more manageably-sized aloes, growing to about 3 ft. tall in flower and spreading into clumps of the same width. A delightful aloe with a hurricane-esque overall form, due to the slight curvature of the ends of each leaf, and a beautiful bluish color.",
    "description": "The name Aloe x spinosissima suggests something ferociously spiny but the teeth that line the leaf margins are not very large or sharp. This plant has the basic shape of Aloe arborescens, only a bit more compact, and the wartiness of aloe humilis.  Fleshy, grey-green leaves with soft spines narrow to a point, growing upright and then gently curving down at the tips. New rosettes grow from the base of the old ones resulting in a wide-spreading clumping form. Clumps grow to be 3 feet tall by 3-5 feet wide.",
    "flowering": "Aloe x spinoissima blooms with 1 1/2 ft. tall spikes of reddish-pink or coral colored tubular flowers in the late winter to early spring. Once it reaches a good size, Aloe x spinoissima flowers regularly every year, sending up a very tall dramatic scape with gorgeous coral red/orange flowers on a large inflorescence.",
    "origin_history": "Aloe spinosissima is an old hybrid whose origins seem lost in time. It has long been in cultivation in California as evidenced by its listing in the 1930 publication Cacti and other Succulents: An Annotated List of Plants Cultivated in Santa Barbara that was written by Ralph Hoffman, E.O. Orpet, Eric Walther and James West and edited by Pearl Chase. In this book it is listed as a hybrid between the toothy form of Aloe humilis known as var. echinata and A. arborescens var. pachythyrsa, but both varieties have now been synonymized with their associated species. It is sometimes sold as Aloe arborescens 'Dwarf'. The name is the superlative form of 'spinosus', which means spiny so would mean 'very spiny' or 'superlatively spiny'. Sometimes called the 'spider aloe' or 'gold tooth aloe.. Sometimes sold as Aloe spinossisima, but should be called Aloe x spinosissima. From Aloe humilis it inherits a small compact size, the many knobbly spines which appear on both upper and lower leaf surfaces and its remarkable tendency to produce lots of offsets from the base. From the much larger Aloe arborescens it inherits larger foliage and a more dramatic presence. For this reason it has often been called Aloe arborescens 'Dwarf', the stemless habit of Aloe humilis predominating over the arborescent habit of Aloe arborescens.",
    "care_cultivation": "Aloe spinosissima is a great midsized landscape aloe for mild climates but unfortunately seems quite attractive to aloe mite. It requires full sun and well-drained soil and should be watered only sparingly. Best grown in a large pot with plenty of grit mixed into the soil. In cooler climates over wintering in a greenhouse or conservatory is recommended. It is fast-growing with a regime of full or partial sun and a very free-draining substrate with plenty of water in the growing season but an easing off of watering as Autumn approaches and stopping altogether during the winter.",
    "frost": "Hardy to 22-25 F. It is cold-tolerant and will take occasional sub-zero temperatures but not substantial frost and is suitable for outdoor cultivation in the UK only in very favorable microclimates in urban areas and south-west coastal districts.",
    "use": "Because Aloe x spinosissima forms large clumps in the landscape, it is best to plant it where it can spread out. It looks beautiful planted with finely textured, drought-tolerant ornamental grasses. The leaf shape and color contrasts with 'roundy moundy' types of plants. In practice, it makes for a more manageable-sized plant particularly in cool climates like the UK where it does not survive outdoors except in very favorable locations and thus makes for a wonderful houseplant, ideal in a terra-cotta container in a light sunny aspect or a conservatory.",

    "slug": "aloe-karasbergensis",
    "aka": ["Karasburg Coral Aloe","Aloe karasbergensis"],
    "overview": "Aloe striata subspecies karasbergensis is well known for its attractive rusty brown to bronze, leaf color, as well as beautiful and charismatic symmetrical leaf crowns. This low-growing, rosette-forming succulent grows to 2-3 feet tall by as wide with interesting pale gray glaucous leaves leaves and essentially no marginal teeth.",
    "description": "Aloe striata subsp. karasbergensis is a relatively large, stemless species with very soft leaves, small marginal teeth, and very ornamental striations the length of each leaf. This is a slightly larger, longer leaved version of Aloe striata. It is also related to Aloe buhrii, but the leaves are soft and more curved and striated. Also similar to the Mbashe Aloe (Aloe reynoldsii). Though often solitary, with age this plant can form clumps from suckers at the base of the rosettes. Stems may reach up to 12 inches (30 cm), with old leaves that persist around the stem. Very broad leaves up to 60 cm tall and 1 meter wide are carried in beautifully symmetric, low-growing, rosettes. The leaves are  pale blue-green, greyish-green to greyish-yellow, ovate-lanceolate, and very rigid to fleshy when turgid. The plant in itself, is very tough, and can survive often for several seasons without water, at which point the leaves turn a reddish color to protect the plant against the high intensity ultra violet sun rays, much in the same way as sun block on the human skin. The leaves also close inwardly to protect the young leaves from heat stress. The species grows well in cultivation and will even tolerate fairly high rainfall conditions, making it an adaptable species to a variety of environments. Large plants look very attractive.",
    "flowering": "The slender 50-75 cm tall, multi-branched inflorescence holds dark pink to red flowers. Flowers multiple times a year but mainly in mid to late winter and flowers last up to three months. The flowers are reddish and short; the inflorescence is very densely branched and pyramidal. These flowers and flowering times differ from Aloe striata which flowers in late winter only, and has orange flowers on much less complex inflorescences. The flowers are tubular in shape with a slight basal swelling.",
    "origin_history": "Karasbergensis is one of two less known, but equally striking, subspecies of Aloe striata. This species comes from the Great Karashberg Range in Northern Cape to South-Namibia, one of the most arid regions of South Africa. Plants have a preference for dry, hot desert to semi-desert conditions, and may be found in dry river beds, rocky hill slopes, and stony rugged mountainous areas, where they are sheltered among boulders and rock massifs. The specific epithet striata literally means ‘marked with lines’, a conspicuous characteristic seen on the leaves of all three subspecies. The subspecies name karasbergensis, refers to the great Karasberg Mountains in the south of Namibia, one of the places where it occurs. The plant was collected in October 1926 by well-known plant collector and botanical explorer, Neville Stuart Pillans (1884–1964) from Rosebank, Cape Town. Pillans decribed the plant when it flowered in his Rosebank garden in February 1928. This aloe is very similar to Coral Aloe (Aloe striata), found mostly to its south, and has historically been lumped with it, but differs in floral features as well as leaf color (gray not green). It was initially lumped in with Aloe striata (which, interestingly, has NO striations) but is now considered a separate species (and I think rightly so). This variety is not endangered.",
    "care_cultivation": "This is a great South African species for cultivation in California. Does OK in full sun but appreciates some shade in extremely hot climates. When over irrigated or in heavy soils the leaves will split open and become vulnerable to rot. Tolerates heat and thrives in sun, though the leaves may end up somewhat bleached. As they are fairly adaptable, seeds grow quite easily, although the flowers are not so attractive as others. They do grow fairly large and specimens may be difficult to garden. Compared to Aloe striata it is a relatively slow grower. But once mature it is a beautiful specimen and often attracts comments due to its striking foliage.",
    "frost": "Considered hardy down near 20F if soils are fairly dry.",
    "use": "Karasburg Coral Aloe is from a very dry winter rainfall area in northwestern South Africa and Namibia, and very suitable for dry Mediterranean-type climates. Great for pot culture or in the dry garden.",

    "aka": ["Coral Aloe"],
    "overview": "Aloe striata, with the common name 'Coral Aloe', is a small, stemless South African Aloe species. Aloe striata is a beautiful succulent up to 18 inches (45 cm) tall and up to 2 feet (60 cm) wide, with rosettes of a few flat, broad, pale gray-green leaves that vary in color depending on the amount of sunlight.",
    "description": "The 'Coral Aloe' is often sold as a solitary plant but will slowly produce new rosettes and eventually form colonies to 3 feet wide. The Foliage of this solitary Aloe might extend to 2 feet above the ground surface. The plants grey-green rosettes are striped with darker green and have translucent red margins. Aloe striata has flat broad that leaves will blush pink in cooler weather or when the plant is under stress. The leaves have notable dark narrow lines running longitudinally (though more pronounced on the ssp. karasbergensis) and toothless, nearly transparent leaf margins. In hot full sun the foliage is pinkish and in more shaded spots they are often bluish-green.",
    "flowering": "Aloe striata gets its name for its coral-red blooms which appear in late winter into early spring. It produces up to three 2 foot (60 cm) tall stems that branch and hold clusters of Brilliantly colored coral-red flowers. The flowers are held, all at the same level, on many branched stalks and brighten the garden for up to three months from winter to spring. Fruits are green and multi-carpulate on long branched stalks and are not particularly showy.",
    "origin_history": "Aloe striata is widely distributed in the dry areas of the Eastern and Western Cape provinces of South Africa, growing from 800 to 7,300 feet in elevation. The specific epithet 'striata' is from the Latin adjective 'striatum' (strio) meaning 'grooved' or 'striped', in reference to the longitudinal stripes of the leaves. Be wary of imposters - much of what is sold as Aloe striata in the nursery trade is actually a garden hybrid that has teeth along the leaf margins - for more information on this see our page on Aloe striata hybrid. karasbergensis and Aloe buhrii is also another species that is similar and sometimes confused with this species. Due to the similarity of their species names, Aloe striata is sometimes confused in literature with Aloiampelos striatula (syn. Aloe striatula, hardy aloe) — a very different plant, found in the highlands of the Eastern Cape.",
    "care_cultivation": "Though Aloe striata is quite tolerant of dry conditions, a plumper plant can be obtained with regular to occasional irrigation so long as soil drains well. From South Africa, this species also has the distinction of not being particularly picky about where it grows, tolerating dry conditions, a regularly watered situation, full sun, part shade and whatever soil you happen to have on hand. Aloe striata will thrive in gravelly, well-draining soil. This is a fast growing aloe in mild climates. Aloe striata will develop from a small seedling to a mature 2-foot flowering plant in two years. Being quite adaptable to most conditions, from shady/moist to full sun, hot and dry, it is very useful in many garden situations.",
    "frost": "Coral aloe is hardy to 20 to 25 degrees F.",
    "use": "Aloe striata is a small-scale clumping aloe for bold textural accent in planting locations ranging from full sun to partial shade, small scale ground cover or edging plant for succulent or rock gardens, great patio container plant or walkway plant. Plant in groups or us as a solitary specimen in the ground or in a large container. Perfect in succulent and cactus gardens and a nice contrast to low-flowing grasses. Works well near walkways and swimming pools as it has no teeth or spines. Very showy when in flower but also during the rest of the year due to its attractive foliage. Flowers attract nectar-loving hummingbirds and insects.",

    "aka": ["Hardy aloe","Aloiampelos striatula","Aloe striatula"],
    "overview": "Aloe striatula is a shrubby, branching and rambling species to 6 feet tall by at least this wide that naturally occurs on the summits of mountains which makes it one of South Africa's hardier aloes. It's dark green, decurving leaves are eventually topped with very showy red and yellow flower spikes in spring and summer continuing into fall.",
    "description": "Colonies of Aloe striatula can grow to contain hundreds of rosettes, taking up a good 15 feet or more in all directions. Rosettes are made up of a long stem covered with leaves sometimes up to its entire length, and sometimes only at the very top depending on available water. Aloe striatula looks a lot like a slender form of Aloe arborescens with smaller rosettes of only barely recurved bright green leaves. The leaves of striatula are dark green and strongly recurved, with numerous small white teeth along their margins. Leaf sheaths are distinctly longitudinally green-lined which gave rise to the plant’s specific name of striatula. Leaves point upward, which makes it easy to tell from Aloe ciliaris, and leaves are relatively thick relative to a similar looking species, Aloe tenuior. Older leaves tend to shrivel up and persist on the lower stems as a dry, pale brown covering. This is a slender suckering aloe that forms clumps/hedges. One of the hardiest of aloes and relatives, it will tolerate a wide range of conditions, and is even known commonly as the 'hardy aloe'.",
    "flowering": "The brilliant yellow inflorescence rises above the foliage typically in late spring into summer but we often have stray flowering at other times of the year. The flowers are yellowish-orange and appear densely on up to 16 inches (40 cm) tall, un-branched, cone-shaped racemes. One of the few flowers that can flower in zone 9a, as the flowers seem as resistant to the cold as the entire plant.",
    "origin_history": "This species come from the Karoo to the Eastern Cape Province in South African and in the mountains of southern Lesotho. The name, striatula, comes from the characteristic stripes on the sheaths of the stems. The plant's Latin species epithet 'striatula' means 'little stripes', and refers to the thin dark-green stripes that can be seen on the plant's leaf sheaths. It is closely related to Cape Town's Aloiampelos commixta, but it is easily distinguished from it by the distinctive dark green stripes on the stems and leaf sheaths (its species name, striatula, means 'little stripes'), and by its thin, recurved leaves (which, like its flowers, are more densely packed). In the Eastern Cape it is often planted along the boundaries of kraals, as it naturally forms a well-shaped and hardy hedge. This aloe grows among rocks on mountain tops within the winter snow belt in one of the coldest parts of southern Africa. It occurs at altitudes from 500 m to 1500 m on rocky outcrops in grassland with extreme temperatures.",
    "care_cultivation": "Plant in full sun and occasional water during hot weather. It will tolerate much colder temperatures than most aloes and relatives, including frost and even some light snow, but it prefers full sun and well-drained soil. Of all the Aloes touted as cold-hardy, this is the one that actually is, and won't give you any trouble about winter moisture or drainage or any of those other bothersome trivialities that frequently afflict hardy succulents. This aloe also seems to be particularly fond of water all year round. Like other climbing aloes, it can easily be propagated by cuttings(truncheons) as well as by seed. It is essential that this spectacular plant with rosettes of deep green leaves have exceptional drainage. In Zone 7b, you will need to provide great drainage and protect the foliage from excess winter moisture to avoid slight foliage burn or rot (we planted ours under the eaves of the house) but either a cloth or upside down pot would do the trick.",
    "frost": "This plant is remarkable in that it is hardy to 15 degrees F. or even a little lower. The smaller form of this Aloe is being grown into zone 7 by those who like to push the limits of plant hardiness as it is thought to be one of the hardier of the shrub aloes. One of the cold hardiest of all Aloes, this shrubby form has been known to take very cold temperatures by dying to the ground and actually re-sprouting from the base.",
    "use": "This drought tolerant plant is truly a must have for any subtropical, Mediterranean or desert-themed garden. Spectacular plant that is also excellent in a container. Aloe striatula 'Burly' makes a good living fence or background plant.",

    "description": "Aloe succotrina is an attractive succulent shrub up to 5 feet (1.5 m) tall. The South African native has 2 foot wide dense rosettes that hold many up-curved 18 inch long by 2 to 3 inch wide leaves. Solitary to sometimes suckering stemless to short-stemmed aloe with blue green thin leaves. It can develop a short trunk but is mostly seen as stemless. They have firm, triangular, white teeth along their margins, which become smaller towards the leaf base. Solitary specimens of the Fynbos Aloe do occur, but this aloe is usually found in small to large, dense clumps. Plants are stemless when young, but branching in older specimens and are covered with the remains of older dried leaves. The purple color of the old leaves is one of the characteristics of Aloe succotrina that helps to distinguish it between similar looking species. Colonies of Aloe succotrina eventually form impenetrable groups. The leaves are fairly fragile and though soft and slightly bendable, break easily. Cut or broken leaves of Aloe succotrina bleed a dark purple and are very staining to clothing.",
    "flowering": "During winter it produces a tall flower with an attractive terminal raceme of red tubular flowers. It is particularly striking when it flowers. Flowers look somewhat like Aloe arborescens flowers. The flower spike is unbranched and grows up to 1 m high. The dark orange-red, simple, tubular flowers have green tips and are up to 40 mm long and appear in mid-winter. They are erect at first, but hang down once they have opened. The fruits ripen in spring, releasing small black seeds.",
    "origin_history": "Growing high up on the cliff faces and rocky outcrops in the mountains of the Western Cape, this is one of only a few fynbos aloes. Aloe succotrina is a true fynbos species and always occurs on quartzitic, sandstone rocks and cliffs of the Cape Fold Mountains, in the extreme southwestern Cape. They grow on sheer cliff faces, hills and rock faces and are restricted to the Cape Peninsula, Hangklip and Hermanus areas. In a number of localities, plants are found to grow amongst and between sandstone boulders. The plants grow from sea level to an altitude of 900 m. It receives winter rainfall and hot dry summers. Aloe succotrina has had a very confused history. Early botanical workers assumed that the plant had originated from the Indian Ocean Island of Socotra, which is the largest of several islands, extending eastwards from the Horn of Africa. Succotrina was thought to be the adjectival form of Socotra. For many years the origin of this plant remained a mystery. It is, however, a Cape plant and in 1906, a precise locality at the Cape was recorded.",
    "care_cultivation": "Plant Aloe succotrina in full sun to light shade in a well-drained soil and irrigate very little as it is particularly well adapted to our California winter rainfall mediterranean climate with very little to no summer irrigation. Space should be provided for maturity, as it eventually grows into a large and dense cluster. This plant does not do well in the summer rainfall region or in rich soils. It is tolerant of near seaside conditions. In pots use a course potting mix. Requires very little maintenance. Divide plants when they become too congested, this should reduce stress on the plants and reduce problems with pests and disease. It is an easy plant that usually does not give many problems in cultivation. During the winter months, the plants should be grown cool to initiate flower development (about 5-10°C )",
    "frost": "Plants have proven cold hardy to 20 F at the Ruth Bancroft Garden in Walnut Creek (see Brian Kemble's List of Cold Hardy Aloes) but if flowering at that time, flowers are damaged.",
    "use": "Aloe succotrina can easily be grown as an ornamental plant in Mediterranean climate gardens, rockeries, and in containers. This aloe is a very nice showy midsize aloe for the garden that is attractive both in and out of bloom and it grows well in containers too. It is cultivated for medicinal purposes in various parts of the world.",

The rosettes have numerous narrow 2 to 3 foot long upright dull bluish-green leaves, sometimes flushed pinkish, that have yellowish teeth turned inwards towards the plant, making this a very friendly plant with no sharp parts to be avoided. Its long tubular leaves are relatively soft and rubbery in texture, with rounded tips. The narrow, rough-textured, leaves are strongly upward pointing and form an impressive, large crown. Aloe suzannae is extremely slow-growing, but eventually becomes tall and arborescent. Very old plants in Madagascar will  eventually branch as evidenced by photos of plants with a huge massive set of branches and reaching up to about 15 feet or more. Large, well grown plants can be rather attractive, but many in the botanical gardens they are floppy, sad affairs, and frankly are rarely that ornamental. Probably a good species for the frost free areas of Arizona.",
    "flowering": "Flowering is a rare event for Aloe suzannae with only maturing plants flowering (at least 20 to 30 years old), and that is infrequent (every 3-15 years). Blooming season is in late winter or early spring. The massive inflorescence which lasts for over a month is unbranched, and densely covered with ivory colored flowers that have yellow stamens. The campanulate shaped flowers are completely covering in length a stout tight spike to 5 feet tall rising above the foliage. It is exceptional in its genus in having nocturnal fragrant flowers, presumably pollinated by nocturnal animals such as bats and small lemurs. It has been observed in the wild with flowers open during the day. Kelly Griffin wrote about this plant in Madagascar, where he got to see a large number of very large plants growing, that this plant flowers both day and night, and pointed out that often repeated nocturnal flowering rule is a long-standing misconception. This plant is at least an unreliable flowerer. It can be years between flowering events for each plant. Some never seem to flower. Fortunately, a number of cultivated plants are now well established and have reached flowering size.",
    "origin_history": "This aloe is endemic to Madagascar, occurring in the dryer south and south-west of the island (Ambosary and Itampolo). Here it grows in sandy soil near the coast, or among rocks. It is considered critically endangered with very few adult individuals known in each subpopulation and no evidence of regeneration. The few plants in botanical gardens were collected more than 50 years ago. French naturalist Raymond Decary (1891-1973) who lived and worked much of his life in Madagascar named this plant in 1921 after his daughter Suzanne.",
    "care_cultivation": "Plant in full sun in a well-drained soil and water very little in summer months. It wants it hot all the time, and pretty dry. In cultivation, Aloe suzannae is best suited to warm temperate and dry tropical climates in USDA Zones 10 and above. Some do not find this an easy aloe to cultivate, and it is a bit prone to fungal infections. It tolerates weekly watering in the summer; once a month, or not at all in the colder months of December and January. Incorrect watering, poor drainage or too much shade can lead to attack by pests and diseases. Also, tissue culture has been used recently to propagate the species but genetic diversity is poor. The seeds should be sown at around 20 C., kept damp and must not fall dry. They will germinate in less than than 2 weeks.",
    "frost": "Long thought tender but many have commented on its ability to take frost and has proven hardy to 25° F.",

    "description": "Aloe tauri forms a dense rosette of dark green, recurved leaves. This plant is stemless, or with a decumbent stem, 1-2 m long, the stem suckering to form large groups of plants. Aloe tauri's rich salmon coloring when in ideal sunlight, and it's long curving leaves make this a much sought-after aloe. Much like Aloe vanbalenii or Aloe dorotheae - Aloe tauri may turn intense orange and red colors in response to cold conditions or in times of drought. The plants color can rapidly reverse to green with red margins within a few days of decent rainfall after an extended drought. The stems and branches of Aloe tauri bear the withered remains of old leaves.",
    "flowering": "The inflorescence develops during winter as an unbranched, to 1 meter long, densely flowered spike. The flowers are sessile, short, bright yellow, and bell-like. The nectar of Aloe tauri is clear whereas the nectar of Aloe spicata is brown.",
    "origin_history": "Aloe tauri, native to southern Zimbabwe, was named after its discoverer, EJ Bullock, using the Latin word for bull. This species is superficially similar to Aloe spicata, and for a while was lumped under that species until a fairly recent treatment of the Aloe genus in Zimbabwe where it was restored as a valid species.

It produces numerous 3 foot tall multi-branching flower spikes topped with pyramidal clusters of tomentose sea-green blooms. This is a large, stemless, solitary plant that forms a single rosette to 2 feet tall by 4 feet wide with pale green leaves and is probably hardier than most would assume since it grows above 2500 meters (8000+ feet).",
    "description": "This is a hardy aloe from the mountains of northeast Africa, Arabia and Yemen. The Hairy Green Aloe forms a pale green rosette that produces delightfully wooly, sea-green flowers in summer. Its single rosette of pale greenish-gray leaves can be up to 2 feet tall and 4 feet across. The sword shaped leaves of Aloe tomentosa are smooth, bright green with toothed edges and a light powdering of blue-green. Juvenile specimens have pale green leaves with many white dots and dashes. The leaves of Aloe tomentosa may have small, blunt, well-spaced marginal white teeth. Aloe tomentosa does not offset very often. Multiple plants are more likely divided heads. A fast-growing species that can reach full size of over 2 feet in diameter in just 5 or 6 years. This is a winter dormant aloe.",
    "flowering": "The flowers of Aloe tomentosa alone make the plant very worthwhile to grow! The inflorescence grows to over 1 meter in height. The blooms are amazing. From mid spring to mid summer, large, highly branched inflorescences tipped with compact conical racemes of white, fuzzy flowers. Flower color is actually a light yellow-green, but because they are generally covered in thick wool (tomentose) the flowers appear white. Blooms are very attractive to bees and hummingbirds and are quite striking in the landscape.",
    "origin_history": "Aloe tomentosa is actually only found in the mountains of Yemen and is probably hardier than most would assume since it grows above 7,000 feet. This aloe gets its name from its unique greenish-white flowers that are covered in thick wool. The unusual woolly flowers are also shared in Africa by Aloe molederana and in Saudi Arabia by either Aloe parvicapsula or Aloe woodii. Aloe tomentosa sometimes grows together with Aloe vacillans and when crossed creates the hybrid Aloe x menachensis. The plants found in Africa belong to Aloe molederana and those found in Saudi Arabia are either Aloe parvicapsula or Aloe woodii. The only truly shared trait in any of these plants are the woolly flowers.",
    "care_cultivation": "The Hairy Green Aloe is very easy to grow and maintain. Plant in full sun to light shade and irrigate infrequently - this is a winter dormant aloe but seems to tolerate winter rainfall if planted in a well-drained soil. Aloe tomentosa is an ideal water-wise plant, especially in arid and semi-arid regions, but it comes from summer-rainfall areas, and appreciates consistent moisture during the summer months. As the plant gets established, reduce the amount of water and don't water at all during the rainy season. Established plants can take care of themselves as they store water in their leaves and are well adapted to an arid environment. Seems to tolerate a decent amount of sun, though is more attractive with some afternoon relief in summer. In warmer country, keep it cool by filtering the afternoon sun, and also avoid using a dark-colored container. Aloe tomentosa prefers soils with a high lime content.",

    "use": "Aloe tomentosa is easy to grow and makes a good landscape plant for gardens with full sun and reflected heat. Makes a beautiful container specimen with the added bonus of bringing the fluffy flowers closer to eye-level. Also use it in rock gardens and among large boulders as an interest plant.

    "overview": "Aloidendron tongaense (Aloe tongaensis) is a freely branching, heavy stemmed tree Aloe bears masses of puffy orange/apricot flowers in late winter. This medium-to-large sized tree aloe, with a rounded crown, growing to 9-12+ feet tall, looks very similar to both Aloe barberae and Aloe eminens. Aloe tongaensis has 18 inch long pale green rubbery leaves that often take on a orange hue during the cooler months of the year.",
    "description": "It grows as a massive, branching tree, almost as tall as its larger and more widespread relative, the giant tree aloe Aloidendron barberae. Formation of heavy, sculptured, grey trunk occurs in only a few years with arching, broad, strap-like, dark green leaves forming the canopy. The leaf-bearing branches are about 30 mm in diameter. The leaves, about 20, are carried in rosettes at the branch ends. The leaves of Aloe tongaensis are firm, leathery and the upper portion deeply channelled. It looks similar to A. barberae, however its leaves are slightly more yellow. The lower surface is rounded and the leaf-margin with small teeth, 2 mm long and 5–10 mm apart. The leaf tip is sharp (acute). It has showy, curved, orange flowers, and grows well in sandy coastal regions. Its roots are fleshy and about 33 mm in diameter in mature plants.",
    "flowering": "The flowers of Aloe tongaensis are it's primary distinctive feature, growing on short multi branched inflorescences, and topped with short, almost capitate racemes of yellow-orange flowers, all facing up until opening at which time they drop downward (this is nothing like an Aloe barberae inflorescence). The flowers also always seem to be reaching for the sky, often far above or at least noticeably above the vegetation (something else one never sees in Aloe barberae inflorescences). The inflorescence is branched like a candle-stick (candelabriform) and up to 350 mm tall and about 190 mm in diameter. The racemes are 40–60 mm long and laxly arranged, ascending, with yellow buds. These are pendent when the flowers open. The fruiting capsules become erect after flowering. The seeds are flattened, winged and about mm  in diameter. Flowering time is mainly autumn.",
    "origin_history": "Aloidendron tongaense, formerly Aloe tongaensis, is a species of plant in the genus Aloidendron, native to sandy tropical coastal forests in KwaZulu-Natal, at the border between Mozambique and South Africa. The specific Latin epithet tongaense, refers to Tongaland in northern, coastal Zululand. This plant has long been considered to be the Mozambique form of the tree aloe, Aloe barberae that grows in the summer rainfall eastern regions of southern Africa. Grower Kevin Coniff named the plant Aloe barberae (Aloe bainesii) ‘Medusa” in the 1980's. He noticed that these plants grew quite differently from typical Aloe barberae, branching and flowering at a younger age and producing pale orange-yellow flowers, instead of pink flowers. In 1994 John Lavranos identified these plants as the Mozambique form of Aloe barberae and noted that the seed for Coniff’s original plants was collected along the Mozambique coast near its capital Maputo. The new species, Aloe tongaensis, was officially described 2011. Leaf size and width alone is one of the best indicators that Aloe tongaensis is not just another Aloe barberae. Eventually Aloe barberaes develop into massive trees, something which Aloe tongensis seem reluctant to do (only growing up to maybe 15 feet tall), and trunk diameter, though pretty thick, pales compared to those of mature Aloe barberaes. Cultivationally the two are very similar, however, with both being among the most cold sensitive of all the aloes, reluctant to die from freezing, but badly damaged at temps below 28F (Aloe tongaensis seems a bit tougher in this respect).",
    "care_cultivation": "Aloe tongaensis prefers full sun and is waterwise when established, but much faster growing with frequent deep waterings between dry periods. It tolerates having water withheld but grows very slowly. Plants grow best in well-drained soil, and should reach flowering size within about eight years. Watering should be reduced in winter. Aloe tongaensis is huge aloe mite magnet. If grown in shady conditions, the leaves tend to be larger. Plants prefer a mineral-poor, slightly acidic, sandy soil. Aloidendron tongaense does best in coastal or semi-coastal gardens or as a container plant. It is easily propagated by branch ends (branch cuttings) or seed. Aloidendron tongaense seed should be sown preferably during the warmer months, in a shady position. Cover with a thin layer of slightly acidic sand, and keep moist. Germination is usually within three weeks. Seedlings grow slow and are best planted out when large enough to handle. Propagation from stem cuttings is best undertaken in spring. Allow the cutting to form a heel, by placing it on a dry window sill for a week. Cuttings are best rooted in containers in a well-drained medium, such as sand. Once rooted, they can be planted in individual containers and kept until well established. Best to feed plants with an organic feeding (compost or any other liquid fertilizer).",
    "frost": "Aloidendron tongaense is hardy to around 22°F. Plants were killed at 20 F during January 2007 cold spell.",

This species has absorbed the former A. dhalensis and A. audhalica, both described in 1965. No specimen survived the original exploration, and a subsequent collection over a hundred years later was incomplete, explaining the relative obscurity of the original A. vacillans at the time these other species were described. There are several varieties and at one time, they were individualized as species, but have since been lumped under A. vacillans. Here are the original 3 varieties based on flower color and habit: Aloe vacillans v. audhalica: Has short pinkish red flowers. Aloe vacillans v. dhalensis: Has short yellow flowers.

    "slug": "aloe-vaotsanda",
    "aka": [],
    "overview": "Perhaps the most handsome Aloe, this solitary, non-branching Madagascan tree aloe is set apart primarily by its unique flowers on long, tapering, bendable leaves. The channeled glaucous leaves tend to grow straight out or down, and then curl inward at the ends much like an Octopus.",
    "description": "Aloe vaotsanda are very attractive with exceptionally long, drooping leaves with a unique way of dragging along the ground as though it were some floating octopus. Like many Madagascan aloes, this species tends to be quite colorful under stress (winter conditions) showing a lot of maroon in its leaves. The Leaves of Aloe vaotsanda remain on stem creating a skirt of dead leaves. Leaf margins armed with rather soft but large whitish sometimes slight hooked teeth. Though rare in cultivation, recently these plants have become much more available. Grows up to 12 feet tall but rather slower to get there than Aloe vaombe.",
    "flowering": "In winter the flowers of Aloe vaotsanda are deep red and very small on a multibranched inflorescence that points in all directions (not upright as the norm for most aloes). Flowers turn from red to yellow briefly as they open, but then the quickly curl back their petals and die, leaving only 1-3 yellow flowers at a time.",
    "origin_history": "This imposing Madagascan aloe not only sounds like A. vaombe but also shares several features with it as well. Both form large solitary rosettes up to 1.5 m across of recurved leaves atop a trunk reaching 4 m or more. In fact, the two are so similar as to be indistinguishable when not in flower. In flower they are quite distinctive, the racemes of A. vaombe being erect, those of A. vaotsanda with an unusual drooping aspect in bud, then oblique at anthesis.",
    "care_cultivation": "Aloe vaotsanda is a full sun species and suffers greatly if grown in shade. Slow growing and needs best warm and well-drained position, or pot.",
    "frost": "It is an attractive and rapidly becoming popular species in California but with only moderate cold tolerance (down to about 27F), showing significant leaf damage and complete flowering failure below that.",
    "use": "With it's attractive and unique foliage, Aloe vaotsanda makes an excellent garden focal point.",

    "overview": "This plant is one of the most beautiful and showy of the South African species of Aloe. Aloe wickensii has solitary, stemless rosettes densely packed with upright, curved smooth turquoisey-grey leaves with small sharp reddish-brown spines along the margins. A very attractive and unique Aloe with spectacular display of bi-colored blooms when in full flower.",
    "description": "Aloe wickensii doesn’t produce offsets, sticking with a singular rosette comprised of slender, chalky blue-green, smooth leaves. The leaves are narrow and oblong, up to 3 feet (90 cm) long and up to 6 inches (15 cm) wide, ascending in a dense apical rosette. Leaf color varying from uniform (without spots) grey-green to dark olive green or turquoisey-grey with a pronounced velvety or rough leaf texture, often tinged purplish in dry conditions. The leaves of Aloe wickensii are stout but slender, stiffly erect and curving slightly inwards. Like many aloes, leaf tip browning can occur if conditions are too dry. Leaf margins have reddish-brown to dark brown deltoid teeth. It grows alone or in small group, usually stemless or has a short, decumbent, hidden stem. Sap bright yellow, drying purplish.",
    "flowering": "The super cool bi-colored red and yellow flowers appear well above the leaves in branched racemes in winter with red buds opening to yellow flowers from the bottom of the inflorescence up. The inflorescence of Aloe wickensii is an erect panicle up to 6 feet (1.8 m) tall, bearing up to 8 racemes.",
    "origin_history": "Aloe wickensii is from an area east of Pietersburg to Burgersfort south to near Marble Hall and Nebo in an area that receives much of its 20-25 inches of rainfall in the summer. It was named for a Mr. Wickens who with a Mr. Pienaar (honored by the very closely related Aloe pienaarii) found this plant 25 miles south of Pietersburg in Northern Transvaal in 1914. This plant is often included into Aloe cryptopoda but this bi-colored form has long been grown under the name Aloe wickensii with Aloe cryptopoda being a more uniformly all yellow or all red form. In the newest book on aloes Aloes: The Definitive Guide (Kew Publishing 2011) it is stated that: 'This striking species is easily recognized by its usually bi-colored racemes of dark red buds opening to bright yellow flowers ... it has been confused with A. cryptopoda from the northern regions of Zimbabwe but can easily be distinguished by its long-acuminate, broad floral bracts and by its flower color'. The similar Aloe lutescens, has the bicolored flowers but is a clump forming plant with yellow green foliage with a narrower inflorescence and blooms a bit later than A. wickensii.",
    "care_cultivation": "Aloe wickensii is native to Summer rainfall regions of South Africa, be sure to give it excellent drainage if it's planted in a garden with wet Winters. It needs full sun to part shade, but plants grown in partial shade usually look healthier and more succulent. It is however very hardy when grown in full sun with the minimum water.",
    "frost": "Hardy to 20°F.",
    "use": "With it's sculptural form and large number of branched inflorescences, Aloe wickensii makes a great specimen in a large pot. Plants can be used as living pillars along driveways or fences or less formally as scattered feature plants in the garden landscape. Aloe wickensii is excellent in succulent and cactus gardens or mixed with other plants in xeriscape gardens. The plant’s flowers attract wildlife – hummingbirds, butterflies and bees.",
